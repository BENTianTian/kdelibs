1. Python installation
Python can be installed in two ways:
a) within Cygwin, using Cygwin's installer (this is the default for now)
   -- we're assuming you will use Cygwin bash shell
b) as Windows app, using standalone installer
   -- we're assuming you will use DOS window as your text shell

Notes: note that two parallel python installation can introduce conflicts
