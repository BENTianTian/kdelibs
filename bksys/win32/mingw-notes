bksys on win32/mingw development notes

2005-09-27 Ralf Habacker 
added initial win32 mingw support using cygwin build environment and -mno-cygwin flag. 

- configure with 
	  CFLAGS="-mno-cygwin -Ikdecore -Imingw" CXXFLAGS="-mno-cygwin -Ikdecore -Imingw" LDFLAGS="-mno-cygwin" scons configure

problems 
- include files from win are partial not usable, I'm currently using a subset of them in a separate 
  folder called mingw (discussion with Jaruslav required where to place). May be the win dir should 
  have a compiler specific structure at now to reduce such conflicts until different compiler 
  support is stable. Then they could be merged together 

- CFLAGS and LDFLAGS/LINKFLAGS are not stored in cache/generic.cache.py GENCCFLAGS -> fixed in svn
