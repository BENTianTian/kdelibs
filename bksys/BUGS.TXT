BUGS
====


generic
-------
* installing versioned libraries is broken at the very moment (ita: works with the miniscons provided)
* duplicate PREFIX entry in modules (ita: done ?)
	rh: not at all - if PREFIX isn't set on configuring, no PREFIX is in cache\generic.cache.py and 
	using env['PREFIX'] anywhere results in runtime error see dcop/SConscript

* SConscript containing "#!/usr/bin/env scons -u" in the first line and run with ./SConscript 	
  does not work -> error "No such file or directory"  (from kde-buildsystem@kde.org)

ita: This is provided so that text editors know SConscript files contain python code
rh: but couldn't this be extended in any way so that running ./SConscript works too, may be a good feature.

-----
* mingw: fix bug in lowlevel.py not detecting winsock gethostname() function 
* fix double global.h occurance (kjs/global.h and kio/kio/global.h), which lets in including the wrong file
