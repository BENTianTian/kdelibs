\section Introduction 

This documentation of the coming KDE buildsystem is currently in a very uncomplete state. 

Some chapters describes the recent implementation and are mostly ready, some chapters 
are in a 'design' state and should be seen as a proposal or specification how thing should 
go. Such pages are marked with 
- 'proposal', when they contains collected informations from discussions and brain storming 
sessions. They need to be reviewed by the build system guru's  before they can marked as 
- 'specification', which they are ready for implementing 

See the \ref toc for the documentation structure \n
See related pages for available topics or the top menu for doxygen generated informations.

Please note that doxygen 1.4.4 has a python parsing problem, which results currently in wrong class descriptions.
