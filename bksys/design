For building objects, one will use the 'obj' builders.
These are python classes that accept 5 types when initialized:
program      : 
shlib        : shared library
staticlib    : static library
convenience  : static library made of objects compiled with pic (position-independent code)
kioslave     : same as shlib, but without 'lib' as a prefix

The existing classes are the following:
* genobj: build generic c++ or c applications, depending on the sources given to build
* qt4obj: build a qt4 object, scanning for moc files and adding the dependencies on .rcc files

Targets are then specified like this:
obj = env.qt4obj('shlib',env)
obj.vnum     = '6.0.2'
obj.target   = 'libDCOP'
obj.source   = 'dcopstub.cpp dcopref.cpp dcopobject.cpp dcopclient.cpp'
obj.uselib   = 'QTCORE QT3SUPPORT KDE4'
obj.libs     = env.join('KDE-ICE', 'libkICE.a')
obj.execute()
