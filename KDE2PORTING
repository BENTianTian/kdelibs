This document contains the changes you have to apply to programs written for
KDE1.1 when you want to port them to KDE2.0.

As a start you should have a look at doc/porting.doc in the Qt package.

* kdelibs/khtmlw
khtmlw has been replaced with khtml. 
- Includes of html.h and htmlview.h should be replaced with 
khtml.h and khtmlview.h. 
- It may also be necessary to include khtmlsavedpage.h, khtmlembed.h or
khtmlcache.h.
- KHTMLWidget::setDefaultFontBase() has been replaced by setFontSizes().
See khtml.h for more information. Examples of its use can be found in
kdehelp/konqueror/kmail.
- Don't forget to change the link-flags! (-lkhtml instead of -lkhtmlw)

* KIntegerLine, KIntLineEdit
KIntegerLine has been renamed to KIntLineEdit. The new header file is called
kintlineedit.h. If you were using the former KIntLineEdit from keditcl.h no
changes should be necessary at all. It is recommended to switch to the new
include file, though.

* KLocale
- i18n is no longer a macro to KApplication::getApplication()->getLocale()->translate, but a function on it's own. klocale is obsolute and replace every call
to klocale->translate with i18n.
The return value of i18n is also no longer a const char*, but a unicode qstring.

* KApplication
doesn't hold any longer a KLocale instance. With this getLocale() and isLocaleInstantiated are now replaced by KGlobal::locale(). This function won't create
an instance on the fly
