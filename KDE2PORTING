This document contains the changes you have to apply to programs written for
KDE1.1 when you want to port them to KDE2.0.

As a start you should have a look at doc/porting.doc in the Qt package.

* kdelibs/khtmlw
khtmlw has been replaced with khtml. 
- Includes of html.h and htmlview.h should be replaced with 
khtml.h and khtmlview.h. 
- It may also be necassery to include khtmlsavedpage.h, khtmlembed.h or
khtmlcache.h.
- KHTMLWidget::setDefaultFontBase() has been replaced by setFontSizes().
See khtml.h for more information. Examples of its use can be found in
kdehelp/konqueror/kmail.
- Don't forget to change the link-flags! (-lkhtml instead of -lkhtmlw)
