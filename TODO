This file is meant to be a place to track of medium to large-scale API changes
that we would like to make for the next binary incompatible release.

- Remove the smart-to-dumb-pointer conversion operator from KSharedPointer
  and replace it with a T* Get() member function. An implict conversion is
  far too dangerous.
  See: http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=4ognb0%243cd%40linda.teleport.com&oe=UTF-8&output=gplain

- Remove all KSocket, KServerSocket, KSocks and KExtendedSocket references
  throughout KDE in favour of libqt-addon's socket implementations.
  (note: if all goes well, libqt-addon will be part of Qt by then)

- Remove all methods marked 'deprecated' in KDE 3.x.

- Fix KMainWindow's use of KApplication refcounting in a less error-prone way,
  probably by using a total refcount of all main windows.

- Make it possible to create a KSystemTray without a KMainWindow and instead lazily
  create the main window on demand.

- Make KSystemTray's Quit option in the context menu call kapp->quit() instead of
  closing all windows, so apps that save their window state on exit don't need
  workarounds to detect a window close caused by the tray rather than the user.

- Make KSystemTray add its own reference to KApp, so tray apps that adhere to the
  style guide can safely close their main window without having to worry about
  the app quitting instead.

- Make some long-lasting operations threaded. There are some operations in KDE that
  take too long on at least ~500MHz hardware to be done using event loops. Examples
  are the use of KLibLoader to dlopen plugins and KRun to fire up other processes.
  Konqueror and KMail tend to stall occasionally too, but that's harder to refactor
  because the bulk of the work there is X11-related.

- Make it possible to use SSL-ed sockets outside KIO. KSSL isn't very suitable for
  reuse, and the certificate dialogs are not even available in public API at all,
  leading e.g. to Kopete IRC duplicating a lot of stuff and all KDE Jabber clients
  based on libpsi (PSI, Light Hawk and Kopete) using homebrewn solutions.
