<h1>THIS DOCUMENT DESCRIBES HOW YOU CAN COMPILE KDE WHEN USING SVN</h1>

<p>(If you use source tarballs, you can skip "make -f Makefile.cvs" and
should use "make distclean" instead of "make cvs-clean")

<p><h3>What you need</h3>

<p>Make sure you get the following stuff from SVN:

<p><ul><li>qt-copy (currently a snapshot of qt-4.x)
<li>arts
<li>kdelibs
<li>kdebase (strongly recommended but not strictly necessary)
<li>any other package you are interested in (as of 07Jun2005, only kdegraphics, kdenetwork, kdegames, kdeedu and playground available)
</ul>

<p>It is important that you compile AND INSTALL the above packages in the 
above order.

<p>Further you will need GNU make, autoconf 2.52 and a working C++ compiler (e.g. gcc 3.3.x). 29 May 2005: It is not yet possible to use automake for compiling KDE-4. The latest version of usermake (from svn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/kdenonbeta/unsermake) is required.

<p><h3>Preparations</h3>

<p>Before you start you must decide two things:

<p>1) Where do you want to have Qt installed? Qt is a bit lame in that it 
basically installs itself in its own source-tree, but symlinks are your 
friend. E.g you could link /usr/local/lib/qt4 to where you keep your Qt 
source. Qt libs then end up in /usr/local/lib/qt4/lib.

<p>2) Where do you want to have KDE installed. A good candidate is /usr/local/kde4

<p>Make sure you do (if using sh, ksh, or bash):
<pre>export KDEDIR=/usr/local/kde4</pre>

<p>With csh or tcsh the following is more appropriate:

<pre>setenv KDEDIR /usr/local/kde4</pre>

<p>Now you want to make sure that Qt and KDE libraries are picked up correctly.

<p>On systems that respond to environment variables something similar to the 
following is appropriate:

<p>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$KDEDIR/lib:$QTDIR/lib

<p>On systems whose diety of choice is ldconfig, try:
<pre>ldconfig -m $KDEDIR/lib
ldconfig -m $QTDIR/lib</pre>

<p>You probably also want to add $KDEDIR/bin and $QTDIR/bin to your path.

<!-- <p>See http://www.kde.org/kde2-and-kde3.html for tips about setting up
KDE 3.0 next to KDE 2.x.-->

<p><h3>Preparing SVN modules</h3>
<p>NOTE: Is this still so?

<p>All KDE modules require an "admin" sub-directory. You can create it by
making a symbolic link from kde-common/admin, make sure to check out the
kde-common module.
<p>
Example:<br>
<pre>
cd kdelibs
ln -s ../kde-common/admin
</pre>

<p>With the new source management technology, Subversion, handling
this special sub-directory has to be done differently. If an "admin"
sub-directory doesn't exist, do as follows($KDE_MODULE is the module
you're working with):
<pre>
cd $KDE_MODULE
svn propset svn:externals admin https://svn.kde.org/home/kde/branches/work/kde4/kde-common/admin

<p>The URL in the above command has to be adapted to your situation:
i.e. replace https with svn+ssh, replace svn.kde.org with your account
name (e.g. username@svn.kde.org) and replace the work branch of the
URL (/branches/work/kde4/) with the branch you're using
(e.g. /trunk/KDE/kde-common/ for the main development tree).

<p><h3>Compiling with unsermake</h3>

<p>The magic sequence to compile &amp; install a package is:
<pre>export PATH=$PATH:/your/path/toward/unsermake/module # for (t)csh: setenv PATH ${PATH}:/your/path/toward/unsermake/module
unsermake -f Makefile.cvs
./configure --enable-debug
unsermake
unsermake install </pre>

<p><h3>Compiling with unsermake and a build directory different than the source directory</h3>

<p>Most of the KDE modules allow to store the compilation (build)
objects at a different location in the filesystem than the location
that contains the KDE sources. This setup provides a few advantages
(like easier cleanup of builds). In order to compile KDE this way, the
following sequence of commands is required, provided that
SRC_DIR=/your/path/to/KDE/sources,
BUILD_DIR=/your/path/to/build/objects/ and $KDE_MODULE is the module
that you want to compile.

<pre>export PATH=$PATH:/your/path/toward/unsermake/module # for (t)csh: setenv PATH ${PATH}:/your/path/toward/unsermake/module
cd $SRC_DIR/$KDE_MODULE
unsermake -f Makefile.cvs
cd $BUILD_DIR
mkdir $KDE_MODULE
cd $KDE_MODULE
$SRC_DIR/$KDE_MODULE/configure --enable-debug
unsermake
unsermake install </pre>


<p><h3>Notes about compiling</h3>

<p>Currently, it is not possible to use automake to generate makefiles
for KDE-4.x. Unsermake is mandatory (see above). It is planned that,
for KDE-4, a new build system to be adopted (like scons:
http://scons.org), in order to paliate for the complex task of
building a project of the size of KDE.

<p>For configuring Qt, the magic sequence is:

<pre>./configure -system-zlib -qt-gif -system-libjpeg -system-libpng -no-exceptions -debug -fast
make</pre>

<p><h3>Common problems</h3>

<p>One of the biggest problems is picking up the correct version of Qt, 
especially if your system has more version of Qt installed. Be aware 
that information about library paths gets saved in the "config.cache" 
file, "Makefile.in" as well as "Makefile" files. So it can be that after 
some struggle to get QTDIR/KDEDIR setup correctly your setup is actually 
correct, but old -incorrect- settings are still lying around.

<p>The best thing to do in such a case is to use the svn-clean script available in kdesdk/scripts . This
removes all files which aren't stored in SVN. You can then start all over
again with "unsermake -f Makefile.cvs". <b>WARNING: Make sure you don't have any important
files lying around in your source tree any more, they will be deleted!</b>

<h4>New directories</h4>:
<p>When a new directory gets added to SVN it usually only contains a
Makefile.am but not a Makefile. If you try to compile such a directory
you will get an error like:

<pre>
  Making all in management
  make[3]: Entering directory /home/gregturp/KDE/kdelibs/kdeprint/management'
  make[3]: *** No rule to make target ll'.  Stop.
  make[3]: Leaving directory /home/gregturp/KDE/kdelibs/kdeprint/management'
  make[2]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
  make[2]: Leaving directory /home/gregturp/KDE/kdelibs/kdeprint'
  make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
  make[1]: Leaving directory /home/gregturp/KDE/kdelibs'
  make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2
</pre>

<p>The solution is to redo "make -f Makefile.cvs; ./configure".

<p>You can create a single Makefile from a Makefile.am file with the
kdesdk/scripts/create_makefile script. Make sure to run it from the toplevel
directory. (E.g. /home/username/KDE/kdelibs)


<p><h3>Problems?</h3>

<p>See <a href="http://www.kde.org/compilationfaq.html">http://www.kde.org/compilationfaq.html</a> for common build problems and their solution.

<p>If you encounter _LINK_ problems you are probably doing something wrong.
Do a "make cvs-clean" and start from scratch, usually this solves the problem.

<p>If you encounter missing include files, especially if the files start with
a 'q', you probably have not setup your QTDIR or LD_LIBRARY_PATH correct or
have the wrong version of Qt,

<p>If you encounter compile errors after updating from SVN, check whether you 
need to update kdelibs as well. If the problems persists, wait a few hours,
usually compile errors are fixed shortly after they have been introduced.

<p>If you still have problems read the kde-devel@kde.org mailinglist and/or
post your problem there. You can subscribe by sending mail to
kde-devel-request@kde.org with "subscribe" in the subject.

<p>Have fun!
