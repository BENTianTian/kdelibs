This directory contains the cmake files required to build 
KDE 3 software.
It requires at least cmake 2.2.4, you can get it from the cmake web site:
http://www.cmake.org or direcly from cmake cvs.
The files FindKDE3.cmake, KDE3Macros.cmake, kde3uic.cmake and
kde3init_dummy.cpp.in all have to be installed in the system 
cmake module directory (typically /usr/local/share/CMake/Modules).
You can either copy them manually to this directory or
let cmake do this for. 
For this run "cmake ." in this directory which will create a Makefile from
the CMakeLists.txt in this directory. The generated Makefile will contain
basically one target, the install target.
So run "make install" as root and then you are ready to use cmake for
building KDE 3 applications.

You can run the (Ruby) script am2cmake to automatically convert 
KDE Makefile.am's to CMakeLists.txt for cmake. Starting from the 
current directory it will convert all Makefile.am's in the subdirectories
to cmake.
