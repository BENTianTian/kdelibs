aRts based mediatool replacement - prototype
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Always wanted to hear mp3's while having still KDE system sounds? Or using
effects or equalizers on your system sounds?

Here is a prototype. It's a drop-in replacement for mediatool in kdelibs.
Just rename the old directory to mediatool.old, copy that in here. You need
to add the file arts.idl from the kmusic/ksynth/src/common directory as well
to this.

After you recompiled and installed kdelibs, you need to recompile/reinstall
kdebase, especially kwmsound/kcmsyssound. You need to make sure that they
link against mico as well.
