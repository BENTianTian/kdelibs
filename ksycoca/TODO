matchFileName [without creating the mimetypes]      (difficult)
Move canossa's koTrader and make it ktrader in libkio 
(no problem but with the parser, the lex & yacc file, libkio is going to grow again)
(well at least we'll have everything about services and servicetypes there)

and then move ksycoca back to libkio
