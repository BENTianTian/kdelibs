 | Dict
 | | * hashtable size
 | | Hash list
 | | | * list of values used to compute a hash key
 | | Hash table
 | | | * id (positive = entry offset)
 | | | * id (negative = - offset in duplicates list )
 | | | * 0 if no entry for that hash value
 | | Table of duplicates
 | | |  * entry offset, key
 | | |  * entry offset, key
 |

| * servicetype offset, service offset
| * servicetype offset, service offset
