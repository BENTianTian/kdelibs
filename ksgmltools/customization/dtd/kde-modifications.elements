<!-- Modification: ReleaseInfo, Date, Abstract and Keywordset are
     compulsory.  Not all orders that could be valid are allowed (the
     number increases factorial).  The current restrictions are quite
     strict, and it is foreseen that they will be relaxed.  Date and 
     ReleaseInfo must come together, as must Abstract and Keywordset.
     Abstract and Keywordset must follow Date and ReleaseInfo when they
     are used the first time.
