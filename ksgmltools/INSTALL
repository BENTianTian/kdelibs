Installation guide to KDE documentation tools (version 0.1-1)
Eric Bischoff, 16 September 1999

==============================================================================

Introduction
============

The tools used at KDE to write and process documentation are based on the
famous "Cygnus distribution", hosted by Cygnus Software. Mark Galassi and many
other nice people gathered and packaged there the ressources written by major
actors of the SGML and DocBook technology, like the OASIS consortium,
James Clark and Norman Walsh. The KDE-specific tools only add minimal
customization to this distribution. This ensures KDE look-and-feel of
the generated documentation, as well as small problem fixes.

The following sections explain how to download, install and run the DocBook
tools.


A - Downloading
===============

1 - Where ?
-----------

You can download the Cygnus distribution of the DocBook tools from :

	ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/docbook-tools/docware

Since this server is very often overloaded, you'd better use one of its
mirrors listed on :

	http://sourceware.cygnus.com/mirrors.html

One of these mirrors is at KDE itself on :

	ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/devel/docbook

but this site is very often overloaded as well.

You can also find some more information about the "Cygnus distribution"
on the home page of the DocBook tools :

	http://sourceware.cygnus.com/docbook-tools

The KDE-specific stuff is located in the directory ksgmltools of the kdesdk
package. The kdesdk package can be found at :

	ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/unstable/CVS/snapshots/current

As said before, this server is quite busy. You will find a list of mirrors at :

	http://www.kde.org/mirrors.html


2 - Which file format ?
-----------------------

The Cygnus DocBook tools are available under different formats :

- If you are using a RedHat-like system on an Intel processor, go to RPMS
  directory. There, you will find RPM packages already compiled for your
  processor (in directory "i386"), and other packages that do not depend on a
  specific architecture (in directory "noarch").

- If you are using a RedHat-like system on some other processor, go to
  directory SRPMS. There, you will find RPM packages of the source code of the
  tools. You will need to compile them yourself.

- If you are not using a RedHat-like system, go to directory SOURCES. There,
  you will find tarballs of the same source code files. You will need to
  compile them yourself as well.


3 - Which packages ?
--------------------

You will need to download at least four packages :

- sgml-common : the tools shared by the other packages ;

- jade : the SGML syntax parser ;

- docbook : the SGML document type definition for DocBook ;

- stylesheets : the style sheets for HTML or TeX rendering.

You may also need one of the two other optional packages :

- psgml : adds-on to the EMacs text editor, for easier doc writing ;

- jadetex : a set of macros that are needed by the TeX files generated by the
  tools, needed for PostScript output.


B - Installing
==============

1 - Clean up first !
--------------------

Some Linux distributions may come with RPM's for Jade and most of the packages
that are needed for DocBook operation are not KDE-specific. Your
distribution's packages are most likely out of date and will not include
version 3.1 of the DocBook DTD or the latest version of the style sheets.
Furthermore, you may have to tinker quite a bit to successfully add the KDE
customizations to another distribution. Therefore, we highly recommend you
uninstall any previous installation before reinstalling according to the
directions given in the next sections.

If you are on a RedHat-like system, you can guess what is already installed
by using a graphical package manager or with the following command lines :

	rpm -qa | grep jade
	rpm -qa | grep docbook
	rpm -qa | grep stylesheet
	rpm -qa | grep sgml-tools

and you may then remove them using the instruction :

	rpm -e <packagename>

You may encounter some conflicts with KDevelop, because this package
depends on sgml-tools which must be removed. This will be fixed in
next versions of KDevelop. Until then, ignore dependencies with
--nodeps option of rpm command.


2 - The Cygnus distribution :
-----------------------------

If you have downloaded the RPM files, install them using a package graphical
installer like kpackage, or the following command-line instruction :

	rpm -i <filename>.rpm

For example :

	rpm -i sgml-common-0.1-3.noarch.rpm

If you have downloaded the tarball archives, use a graphical
archive manager like ark, or the following command-line instructions :

	gunzip <filename>.tar.gz
	tar xvf <filename>.tar

If you have installed the SRPMs source archives, you will use a mixture of both
techniques :

	rpm -i <filename>.src.rpm
	tar xzvf <filename>.tgz

In all cases, install the packages in the following order :

	a) sgml-common b) jade c) docbook d) stylesheets

If you have downloaded source packages or tarballs, you will then need to
compile Jade. Fortunately, Cees De Groot has added autoconf support. Just go to
Jade's newly created directory and type :

	./configure
	make
	make install

Beware : it won't work if you haven't libc.so.6 installed.

Now the Cygnus distribution is installed, you must add the KDE specific stuff.


3 - KDE customization :
-----------------------

You will find the necessary files in the kdesdk package.

If you have installed RPM packages, go to the directory where you
have downloaded the kdesdk package, enter the "ksgmltools"
subdirectory and type (as normal user) the commands :

	make -f Makefile.cvs
	./configure

then type (as root) the following command :

	make install

and that's all !

If you have installed SRPMs or tarballs, it's slightly more complicated. The
idea is to control directly Jade. Here is a small script I use to convert
from DocBook to HTML without the Cygnus magic scripts :

	SGML_CATALOG_FILES=customization/kde.cat
	SGML_CATALOG_FILES=$SGML_CATALOG_FILES:dtd/docbook-3.1/docbook.cat
	SGML_CATALOG_FILES=$SGML_CATALOG_FILES:stylesheets/stylesheets.cat
	SGML_CATALOG_FILES=$SGML_CATALOG_FILES:jade/dsssl/catalog
	export SGML_CATALOG_FILES
	echo Processing $1...
	jade -t sgml -d customization/stylesheets/kde.dsl#html $1

You will probably need to adapt this script to your own needs.


C - Running
===========

1 - How do I process DocBook files ?
------------------------------------

At the present time, the only thing you can do with DocBook files is to
convert them to some other format. That is not too bad : DocBook is a very
good format for documentation, and it allows you to focus on the contents of
your documents instead of their presentation.

Maybe someday it will be possible to browse directly the DocBook files
contents, for example with a new KDE help center, but we will have to change
first the dialect we use : we will need to change from SGML-DocBook to
XML-DocBook (it is no big change, though).

But let's stop speaking about the future, and let's see how to convert DocBook
files to some other format.

If you have installed RPMs, type :

	db2html -d <stylesheet> <filename>.docbook	to convert to HTML
	db2ps -d <stylesheet> <filename>.docbook	to convert to PostScript
	db2pdf -d <stylesheet> <filename>.docbook	to convert to PDF
	db2rtf -d <stylesheet> <filename>.docbook	to convert to RTF
	db2dvi -d <stylesheet> <filename>.docbook	to convert to TeX DVI

For example, you can try to convert the KDE template file for docbook
documents :

	db2html -d /usr/lib/sgml/stylesheets/kde.dsl template.docbook

This should produce a new directory that contains the resulting HTML files.
Kfm will encounter some difficulties to follow the links that are in those
pages. This will be fixed soon.


2 - How do I learn DocBook syntax ?
-----------------------------------

Where will you go next ? Maybe you will try to learn how the DocBook syntax.

You might find two other tools (also in the kdesdk package) very useful for
that purpose :

- the template file : if you have to write a new docbook file, just fill in
the blanks

- the crash-course : it will explain you the docbook syntax

The DocBook Reference Manual is NOT included in the Cygnus distribution.
But the distribution conforms to the version 3.1 of the DocBook norm,
whereas the Reference Manual still conforms to version 3.0, so maybe it is
better like that... Anyway, if you do want to download the older version, it
can be found at :

Conclusion
==========

Now you should have everything necessary to write and translate KDE
documentation.

Please also report any bug you could find in this small installation guide.

Have a lot of fun with DocBook !
