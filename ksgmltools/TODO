* Style sheets
- check interpretation of generated keywords in HTML
+ crystal clear documentation: where does the code come from and how was it
  modified, what were the reasons for it. (in which case the structure of the
  files does not need to be similar)
+ fix ALT= and </P> problems: Will happen when mediaobject is used instead of
  graphic and when the library is used.  The </P> problem is unsolved as yet,
  but patched in the CSS style sheets.
- othercredit: translators should be inserted
  author/authorgroup: what it says
  contrib: contributors to the *text*
  othercredit: translators and proofreaders
  Distinction should be made between text and software (and indicated)
  ChangeLog: in reference doc and ChangeLog file - not in documentation
  Translators can change: lang attribute in top element, id attribute in all
  but anchors, othercredits: add translators and contributors to translation
  RevHistory: changes to the text(!)
- abstract: make more clear from layout (?)
- make list of authors/contributors from code, and put them at the back of the
  document if html, at the front on verso if printed
- decide on swapover date for patches (and make old version available)
- make script that allows to check if entities are out of date (*.dsl is too
  hard) from English
- investigate image printing/HTML

- Add language to link to chunk is that it is different (both in HTML
  and in the visible text)
