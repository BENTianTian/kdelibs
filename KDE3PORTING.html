<H2>Porting Applications to KDE 3.0</H2>
This document contains the changes you have to apply to programs written for
KDE 2.x when you want to port them to KDE 3.0.<P>

As a start you should have a look at doc/porting.doc in the Qt package,
or <a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/porting.html">this page online</a>.<P>

<H3><A NAME="gettingstarted">Getting started</A></H3>

  The first step to get your KDE application to compile under KDE 3.0,
  is to detect KDE 3.0 and Qt 3.x at configure time. The easiest way to
  get a working autoconf/automake framework, is to either use 
  <a href="http://www.kdevelop.org">KDevelop</a> or
  <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~granroth/kapptemplate/index.html">kapptemplate</a>
  (available in CVS under the module "kdesdk"), to generate a new
  application template. Replace the generated source files by yours
  and adapt Makefile.am accordingly.
<p>
  Please note that we tried to be mostly source-compatible where it
  was possible. To accomplish that, we added commonly used but still
  deprecated / removed API parts in a #ifndef KDE_NO_COMPAT-block. 
  That means you can "test" and adjust your application by #defining
  KDE_NO_COMPAT for compiling and see where it breaks. This is
  recommended, as those backward compatibility "hacks" are not kept for
  long.

<H4>KDesktopWidget</H4>
KDesktopWidget is obsolete. Include &lt;qdesktopwidget.h&gt; and use QDesktopWidget
instead, everything else is source compatible.

<H4>Header file names</H4>
<UL>
<LI>kapp.h is now kapplication.h</LI>
<LI>kuniqueapp.h is now kuniqueapplication.h</LI>
<LI>kstddirs.h is now kstandarddirs.h</LI>
</UL>
This is to help finding out header files from classnames and the other
way round. Compatibility headers have been created. You can use them as 
long as you don't compile with KDE_NO_COMPAT.

<H3><A NAME="kdeui">Changes in kdeui</A></H3>

<H4>KPanelApplet</H4>
A new protected member method 'void reportBug()' was added. It gets called by
Kicker if the 'Report Bug' entry in the context menu gets selected and should
be overridden by applets which support the KPanelApplet::ReportBug action. This
means that you don't have to extend KPanelApplet's generic action dispatcher
void KPanelApplet::action() anymore.

<H4>KPanelMenu</H4>
The old KPanelMenu class has been renamed to KPanelAppMenu. The KPanelMenu
class now corresponds to a new Kicker menu extension that is handled
by the panel in a way similar to other applets (shared library loaded
at run-time). See KDE 3.0 documentation
for more informations on this new extension.

<H4>KRootPixmap</H4>
The KRootPixmap class has been extended to make it more flexible, and the
<i>checkAvailable(bool ignored)</i> method has been renamed <i>isAvailable()</i>.
The old name will still work unless KDE_NO_COMPAT is defined.

<H3><A NAME="khtmlpart">API-cleanups in KHTML</A></H3>

There were a few relatively minor API-adjustements in KHTMLPart. In particular: 
<ul><li>enableJScript(bool) has been replaced by setJScriptEnabled(bool)
<li>enableJava(bool) has been replaced by setJavaEnabled(bool)
<li>enablePlugins(bool) has been replaced by setPluginsEnabled(bool)
<li>autoloadImages(bool) has been replaced by setAutoloadImages(bool)
<li>enableMetaRefresh(bool) has been replaced by setMetaRefreshEnabled(bool)
<li>setBaseURL and setBaseTarget have been removed. baseURL(), baseTarget() and
completeURL() are remained for compatibility reasons, but they're deprecated now. use the variants in DOM::HTMLDocument() instead. 
<li>the second parameter of KHTMLPart::completeURL is removed. it didn't have 
   any effect before either. 
</ul>
Besides that, all methods previously marked as deprecated or were internal
but accidently part of the public API are now private or removed. 
As they were marked as becoming private already you should not experience
any problems. Backward compatibility exists for the common methods, to
disable this use a #define KDE_NO_COMPAT. 
<p>In KHTMLView, the following changes were done:
<ul>
<li>gotoNextLink has been replaced by gotoLink(true);
<li>gotoPrevLink has been replaced by gotoLink(false);
</ul>
