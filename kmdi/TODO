- fix .xpm file stuff to be more KDE-conform
- if QDockWindow becomes more protected and virtual than private, change from base class KDockWidget to QDockWindow
- add splitter mode for Kate-like MDI appearance
- add IDEA mode (like in Gideon)
- fix KDE style guide (allow MDI for project-based apps)
