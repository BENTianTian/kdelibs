KSpell is the spelling checker used by KDE applications such as KEdit,
KMail, KRN, and KWord. It is a GUI frontend to International ISpell
and ASpell. (If you do not have Ispell installed you can obtain it
from the <htmlurl url="http://fmg-www.cs.ucla.edu/geoff/ispell.html"
name="International ISpell home page">.  ASpell is available from the
<htmlurl url="http://metalab.unc.edu/kevina/aspell/" name="ASpell home page">.)

<sect>Misspelled Word Dialog

<sect1>General Use 
<p>
The top line in the dialog displays a misspelled word which was found in your
document. KSpell attempts to find an appropriate replacement word. One or
several may be found. The best guess is shown to the right of <em/Replacement:./
To accept this replacement, click on <bf/Replace./ You may also choose a word
from the list of <bf/Suggestions/ then click <bf/Replace/ to replace the
misspelled word with the chosen word.

To keep your original spelling, click on <bf/Ignore./

To stop the spell checking -- keeping the changes you've already made -- click
on <bf/Stop./

To stop the spell checking and cancel the changes you've already made, click on
<bf/Cancel./

<sect1>Other Functions
<p>
Clicking on <bf/Replace All/ will initially perform the same function as
clicking on <bf/Replace,/ but will automatically replace the misspelled word
with the chosen replacement word if it appears again (at a later point) in your
document.

The <bf/Ignore All/ button ignores this and all future occurrences of the
misspelled word.

Clicking on <bf/Add/ will add the misspelled word to your personal dictionary
(this is distinct from the original system dictionary, so the additions you make
will not be seen by other users).

<sect>Configuration Dialog 

<sect1>Dictionaries
<p>
You can choose the dictionary to use for spell checking from the list of
installed dictionaries.

<sect1>Encodings
<p>
The available character encodings are:
<descrip>
<tag>7-Bit/ASCII</tag> This is the character set used for English text.
<tag/Latin1/ This is used for Western European languages.
<tag/Latin2/ This is user for Eastern European languages.
</descrip>

You should select the one that matches the character set you are using.
In some cases, dictionaries will support more than one encoding.  A
dictionary might, for example, accept accented characters when <em/Latin1/ is
selected, but accept email-style character combinations (like <em/'a/ for an
accented <em/a/) when <em>7-Bit/ASCII</em> is selected.  Please see
your dictionary's disctribution for more information.

<sect1>Spell-checking client
<p>
You may choose to use <em/Ispell/ or <em/Aspell/ as the spell-checking
backend for <em/KSpell/.  <em/Ispell/ is more widely available and may
have better international support, but <em/Aspell/ is gaining
popularity as it claims to give better suggestions for word replacements.

<sect1>Other
<p>
It is recommend that you do not change the first two options unless you have
read the Interational ISpell man page.
