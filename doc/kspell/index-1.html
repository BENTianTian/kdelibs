<P>The top line in the dialog displays a misspelled word which was found in your
document. KSpell attempts to find an appropriate replacement word. One or
several may be found. The best guess is shown to the right of <EM>Replacement:.</EM>
To accept this replacement, click on <B>Replace.</B> You may also choose a word
from the list of <B>Suggestions</B> then click <B>Replace</B> to replace the
misspelled word with the chosen word.
<P>To keep your original spelling, click on <B>Ignore.</B>
<P>To stop the spell checking -- keeping the changes you've already made -- click
on <B>Stop.</B>
<P>To stop the spell checking and cancel the changes you've already made, click on
<B>Cancel.</B>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Other Functions</A>
</H2>

<P>Clicking on <B>Replace All</B> will initially perform the same function as
clicking on <B>Replace,</B> but will automatically replace the misspelled word
with the chosen replacement word if it appears again (at a later point) in your
document.
<P>The <B>Ignore All</B> button ignores this and all future occurrences of the
misspelled word.
<P>Clicking on <B>Add</B> will add the misspelled word to your personal dictionary
(this is distinct from the original system dictionary, so the additions you make
will not be seen by other users).
