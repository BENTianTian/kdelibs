Installing Apple mDNSResponder:

1) download mDNSResponder 
 - from CVS (see 	http://developer.apple.com/darwin/projects/rendezvous/).
 
 - or you can get tarball from: http://helios.et.put.poznan.pl/~jstachow/pub/mDNSResponder-85.tar.bz2

2) compile and install
 Build system for mDNSResponder is quite weird so here are instructions:
 
 cd mDNSPosix
 make os=linux             (make without parameters gives list of supported systems)
 now as root:
 make os=linux install
 
 make sure that mdnsd.sh init script is properly installed and will be executed at  boot time
