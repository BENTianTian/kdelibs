This library is severely functionally challenged.

This TODO happens to cover SSL in all of KDE though.

- The CA root is not done.  We have to find a standard way of handling the
  directory in the user's .kde path.  The initial path is in the cvs but
  it has to be copied to /usr/share/.....  for installation as a new user
  runs KDE for the first time  We have to find a standard way of handling the
  directory in the user's .kde path.  The initial path is in the cvs but
  it has to be copied to /usr/share/.....  for installation as a new user
  runs KDE for the first time.

- We have to find a way to create the hashes in the CA root directory or
  certificate validation will not work by any means.

- The ASN1 date conversion code doesn't take international issues into
  account by any means.

- KSSL needs to be integrated into the slave base in some
  way or another so that kio_pop3 and friends can use it.

- KHTML needs a dialog to warn on an insecure post (unencrypted)
  if the user has selected to do so in kcmcrypto

- KHTML needs a dialog and logic to warn on pages that have some
  frames in SSL and others in non-SSL

- HTTP IOSlave needs to send a message through the UI server to 
  warn on a failed certificate check and prompt for proceed/abort

- The policies for certificates need to be implemented (accept from
  this site even though it is self signed, etc)

- There needs to be a way to warn the user if an SSL page does a redirect
  to a non-SSL page

- The "back" button on konqueror doesn't behave well with kio_https.  Try
  it, you'll see :)

- Provide an option to not load insecure portions of a secured page

- kcmcrypto certificate managing code is not implemented yet

- Displaying SSL info from the message boxes doesn't work in konqueror/khtml.

- Personal, other certificates are not implemented

- The certificate cache is not implemented.  This is needed to keep track of
  certificates we have seen this session so we don't prompt the user 300 times
  each time a page loads.

- The certificate factory is not done.  This is needed to generate personal
  certificates (self signed) for users.

- The certificate home is not done.  It will manage the user's certificates.
