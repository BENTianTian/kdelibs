- KSSLServer class needs to be written (in a separate lib!!) so that an app
  can act as an SSL server.

- Friend certificates (for S/MIME) are not implemented

- The certificate factory is not done.  This is needed to generate personal
  certificates (self signed) for users.
  This should be a separate app I guess, and can include a CA signer even.

- Document libkssl interface

- CRL support (not much left to do?)

- Code checking for OCX.
