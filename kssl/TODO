- KSSLServer class needs to be written (in a separate lib!!) so that an app
  can act as an SSL server.

- The certificate factory is not done.  This is needed to generate personal
  certificates (self signed) for users.
  This should be a separate app I guess, and can include a CA signer even.

- Document libkssl interface

- CRL support (not much left to do?)

- Code checking for OCX.  

- Dialog boxes for personal certificates need to be queued so that a user
  isn't prompted for a certificate when he already answered for a given site.

- KSSLD should emit dcop signals to tell people when things change

- <keygen> is not working.

- kio_ftps and kio_nntps could be quite nice to have (ftp is quite a problem to
  implement though)

- X509v3 should use X509_PURPOSE instead of the bit checks.  This will be more
  reliable and is quite easy to implement, really.
