WARNING:
  DO NOT USE THIS LIBRARY YET.  IT IS UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT AND MAY
  CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE.

This library includes cryptographic software written by Eric Young
(eay@cryptsoft.com).

This set of classes is designed to make SSL easier to integrate in KDE
applications.  It currently uses OpenSSL and if it is not successfully
linked with OpenSSL, then it will do virtually nothing.  The SSL settings
for a user are shared across applications and managed with the kcontrol
module "crypto".  If this file is not updated by release, you can contact
the author for development information.

The carootfiles directory:



  These files are copied verbatim from OpenSSL but are included here because
not everyone is using OpenSSL v0.9.6.  Previous versions did not include 
these and thus we're better off putting them in ourself.


What they are:

  These are the root files from the certificate signing authorities.  They
allow us to verify certificates (both personal and site) to insure that they
are authentic.
