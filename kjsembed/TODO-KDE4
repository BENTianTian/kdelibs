Ian's List:
* Slot return types should use the value factories so all
  bound types are supported.
* Ability to layer bindings.
	- Matt says that by using QCoreApplication we get a large
	  speedup.  If we can layer the bindings so that users
	  could start with only core Qt.  Then we give the ability
	  to add on KDE and Qt gui bindings at run time.  This
	  will keep small scripts with out guis fast, but not
	  make adding KDE support harder.
* Bindings for KParts (be able to load readonly and readwrite parts)
* Bindings for KIO (net access api)
* Bindings for DCOP (dbus or what ever it is this week)
* Handle QPixmap and Image gracefully in QPainter bindings.

Rich's List:

* Automatic binding generator.

  This is needed at the very least to make it easy for people to be
  able to bind their own classes into the interpreter when embedding.

* A good example of how to embed the interpreter.

  The editor example is a good start for this.

* Get the bindings like bind_qworkspace I did in Malaga into the main
  tree (they're in editor at the moment).

* Improve the documentation so people can use this stuff!

* Get f'ing QListWidget working so we can port the docviewer properly.

* Check the design of the JS-side APIs to ensure they're what we
  really want rather than just "because that's how did it when we
  we're trying to get stuff working".
