Ian's List:
* Slot return types should use the value factories so all
  bound types are supported.
* Ability to layer bindings.
	- Matt says that by using QCoreApplication we get a large
	  speedup.  If we can layer the bindings so that users
	  could start with only core Qt.  Then we give the ability
	  to add on KDE and Qt gui bindings at run time.  This
	  will keep small scripts with out guis fast, but not
	  make adding KDE support harder.
* Bindings for KParts (be able to load readonly and readwrite parts)
* Bindings for KIO (net access api)
* Bindings for DCOP (dbus or what ever it is this week)
* Handle QPixmap and Image gracefully in QPainter bindings.
