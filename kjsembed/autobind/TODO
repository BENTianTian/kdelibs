rich:
OK, admittedly I plowed through a whole lot of this tonight ;)
Here are the changes and things that need to be handled:
First, I decided to start off with the basic value types we have
a) we need to find a way to determine whether the parameter types are values, objects or enum types
b) figure out if doxygen will give us a list of enums, so we can generate the macros for that
c) making a function for contains would be nice (instead of all that indexOf shite)
d) figure out a way to determine which Qt headers need to be included for the generated source (maybe just include <QtGui>?)
e) I didn't touch the method lut generator so that need to be fixed as well
f) not all bindings just return values, sometimes they set things on the value passed to it..

there's probably a bunch of stuff I forgot, but I'm somewhat hopeful this can work heh, the QBrush bindings are the ones I've been looking at and they're really getting there.. good luck young skywalker :)

Notes:
 * In valuetypes we can get away with checking enum types in parameters by just searching for "Qt::" this will not hold up in objects.
