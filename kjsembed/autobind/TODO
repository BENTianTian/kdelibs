erik:
Here are the changes and things that need to be handled:
First, I decided to start off with the basic value types we have
a) we need to find a real way to determine whether the parameter types are values, objects or enum types
b) deal with const & arguments.
b) making a function for contains would be nice (instead of all that indexOf shite)
c) figure out a way to determine which Qt headers need to be included for the generated source, beyond the header used for the definition.
e) I didn't touch the method lut generator so that need to be fixed as well
f) not all bindings just return values, sometimes they set things on the value passed to it..
g) make it so the bindings actually compile.
h) create a wizard to automagically generate the appropriate Doxyfile, call doxygen, and generate the appropriate code.

rich:
there's probably a bunch of stuff I forgot, but I'm somewhat hopeful this can work heh, the QBrush bindings are the ones I've been looking at and they're really getting there.. good luck young skywalker :)

Notes:
 * In valuetypes we can get away with checking enum types in parameters by just searching for "Qt::" this does not hold up in objects.
