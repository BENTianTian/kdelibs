Known Issues [OUTSTANDING]:
===========================
* [QtWebKit] HTML 5 <video> tag will not work properly until Qt 4.7 for most depending
  on how their distro created the Qt library package. Due to differences in the Phonon 
  library used by Qt and KDE, most distros disable support for Phonon when compiling 
  Qt and simply use the Phonon libraries from kdesupport. Unfortunately, disabling phonon
  support in Qt means no HTML 5 multimedia feature (<video> tag) support in the QtWebKit
  module. See https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=34631

* [QtWebKit] No Java applet support.
  See https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=36902.

* [QtWebKit] No way to stop redirection/refresh requests set using the <meta>
  tag, e.g. <META HTTP-EQUIV="Refresh" CONTENT="3;URL=http://www.some.org/some.html">
  See https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29899

* [QtWebKit] No access to the input/control widgets making it very difficult to
  add very useful features such as:
    ** Form completion like the one available for native widgets, e.g.
       QLineEdit and QComboBox. See https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=36668
    ** Spell checking specially for <textarea> widgets.

* [QtWebKit] Only <meta> tags that contain a "name" attribute are properly parsed
  and returned through QWebFrame::metaData.

* [kdewebkit] Unsupported content handling always requires more than one
  connection to the same server to download a single request. The fix for this
  issue requires a new API addition to KIO that accepts QNetworkReply instead
  of KUrl as its data source.

Known Issues [ADDRESSED]:
=========================
* [QtWebKit] Crash browsing facebook.
  See https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35204.

* [QtWebKit] Does not have support "Content-Disposition". Specifically
  when it contains the keyword "attachement" the content returned is not
  supposed to be rendered. Test case site: http://greenbytes.de/tech/tc2231/
  See https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=36395.
