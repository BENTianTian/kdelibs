drawComplexControl:
  CC_SpinBox:
    Needs to honor stepEnabled
    
  CC_ComboBox:
    Interaction with some of the style option flags (frameless, non-editable, etc.) seems missing
    Need to check frame w/designer, at least. Not clear how editable interacts with the SC flags --- 
    might still pass SC_All?

  CC_ScrollBar:
    Fallback to QCommonStyle. Should be OK...

  CC_Slider:
    Looks fine...

  CC_ToolButton:
    Needs to handle the QStyleOptionToolButton::Arrow feature, though perhaps in CE_ToolButtonLabel?

  CC_TitleBar:
    Looks OK

  CC_Q3ListView:
    Looks OK

  CC_GroupBox:
    No handling (Qt 4.1)

    QCommonStyle breaks it up into PE_IndicatorCheckBox, PE_FrameGroupBox, and PE_FrameFocusRect,
    along with drawItem text. Need to check with Oxy folks on what their goals are. Probably need at 
    least a nice placeholder WT for the frame PE, not sure the rest can probably be pushed back to 
    4.1 or 4.0.x

    Also, need to file a Qt docs bug that drawComplexControl docs don't mention QStyleOptionGroupBox for CC_GroupBox
    
  CC_Dial:
    QCommonStyle does something reasonable. No need to style this, I think, it's (thankfully) hardly ever used.

  CC_MdiControls:
    No handling (Qt 4.3)
    Should probably integrate with CC_TitleBar handling somehow, but may need a flag or something to distinguish them, perhaps
    some sort of bevel/bevelless mode in ButtonKOpt? Definitely a lot of overlap..
    Side note: only passes in QStyleOptionComplex
