/** \mainpage The KDEfx Library

This library provides various classes related to image and pixmap
manipulation, a class that provides information about CPU support
for architecture specific features, as well as the base class for
the %KDE widget styles.
<p>
The two graphical effects classes, KImageEffect and KPixmapEffect,
provide static methods for applying graphical effects to images and
pixmaps respectively. KImageEffect also provides highly optimized
methods for compositing images.

A class that's related to those two is KPixmapSplitter, which is
used for calculating the positions of items in pixmaps with
multiple items arranged in rows and columns.
Another is KPixmap, which extends QPixmap with the capability to
ensure that a 256 color pixmap uses a specific system wide
palette.

The KCPUInfo class provides a means for applications to obtain
information at runtime about processor support for certain
architecture extensions that are useful when processing images,
such as MMX, SSE, 3DNow! and AltiVec.

KStyle is the base class for the %KDE widget styles. It simplifies
and extends the QStyle API in order to make style coding easier.
It also provides an internal menu transparency and drop shadow
engine, which means that all styles inheriting this class will
automatically support those features.
