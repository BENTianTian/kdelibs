Since 2.2 release, Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * automatic filtering: if the input file format is not directly supported
    by the print spooler, kdeprint will try to convert the file to the
    primary supported input format (usually PostScript). To achieve this, 
    kdeprint uses the available filters (defined in XML files) and tries to
    build up a filter chain.
  * mime type checking: when building a filter chain, kdeprint checks that
    each output format is supported as an input by the next filter
  * possibility to specify input file from the print dialog in StandAlone
    mode (like XPP)
  * kmvirtualmanager.cpp: KMPrinter::Virtual is only set for pure virtual
    printers (== non empty instance name). This makes KPrinter::isVirtual()
    more useful.
  * CUPS plugin:
  	- support for quotas and user access restrictions (in wizard and
	  print manager)
	- added missing options in server configuration tool
  * Possibility to use an external preview program (still need a GUI to
    configure this).
  * print dialog: possibility to select the files to print in standalone
    mode (like XPP).

  * implementation of "Schedule" tab in print dialog for the CUPS plugin
    (job-hold-until attribute).
  * Printer aliases are now handled gracefully in the LPR plugin (they
    are actually discarded)
  * kprinter.cpp: implementation of setPrintProgram() as:
  	setOption("kde-isspecial", "1");
	setOption("kde-special-command", cmd);

28/08/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * implementation of KPrintAction, which provides a quick access to
    a class of printers (special, regular or both). An application just
    needs to create a KPrintAction anc connect to print(KPrinter*).

31/08/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * CUPS plugin: fix crash for Qt3 port, must check if attr->name is NULL
    before comparing it with strcmp or strncmp.

12/09/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * Management library: set all toolbars non movable to avoid move handles

13/09/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * CUPS plugin: fix multiple showing of password dialog for password-
    protected printers (timer is now blocked when the password dialog is
    shown)

14/09/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * CUPS plugin: configuration wizard rewritten using the structure of
    ESP PrintPro: more consistent, less pages and widgets. Not used as
    default config wizard yet.
  * QList -> QPtrList

25/09/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * CUPS plugin: made the new configuration wizard as default one.
  * other QList -> QPtrList fixes (commited to CVS)
  * Avoid to call plugin functions "completePrinter<xxx>" for pseudo
    printers (to not confuse the CUPS daemon for example)
  * Improved how the default printer is selected in print dialog to
    work in any cases
  * General: make use of KLocale::pageSize() to determine the default
    page size (used for example for pseudo printers and classes)
  * Wizard: fix buffer overflow when adding a remote LPD queue having
    a lot of jobs waiting

03/10/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * CUPS plugin: make use of GET/PUT request to handle configuration
    file. Possibility to admin a remote CUPS server (if allowed)
  * CUPS plugin: added "/jobs" in the available resources list

09/10/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * CUPS plugin: added 2 missing pages in stand-alone mode, "Image"
    and "Text".

10/10/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * CUPS plugin: "HP-GL/2" page added
