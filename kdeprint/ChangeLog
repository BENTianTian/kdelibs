  * automatic filtering: if the input file format is not directly supported
    by the print spooler, kdeprint will try to convert the file to the
    primary supported input format (usually PostScript). To achieve this, 
    kdeprint uses the available filters (defined in XML files) and tries to
    build up a filter chain.
  * mime type checking: when building a filter chain, kdeprint checks that
    each output format is supported as an input by the next filter
  * possibility to specify input file from the print dialog in StandAlone
    mode (like XPP)
  * kmvirtualmanager.cpp: KMPrinter::Virtual is only set for pure virtual
    printers (== non empty instance name). This makes KPrinter::isVirtual()
    more useful.
  * CUPS plugin:
  	- support for quotas and user access restrictions (in wizard and
	  print manager)
	- added missing options in server configuration tool
  * Possibility to use an external preview program (still need a GUI to
    configure this).

  * implementation of "Schedule" tab in print dialog for the CUPS plugin
    (job-hold-until attribute).
  * Printer aliases are now handled gracefully in the LPR plugin (they
    are actually discarded)
  * kprinter.cpp: implementation of setPrintProgram() as:
  	setOption("kde-isspecial", "1");
	setOption("kde-special-command", cmd);

  * implementation of KPrintAction, which provides a quick access to
    a class of printers (special, regular or both). An application just
    needs to create a KPrintAction anc connect to print(KPrinter*).
