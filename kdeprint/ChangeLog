Since 2.2 release, Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * automatic filtering: if the input file format is not directly supported
    by the print spooler, kdeprint will try to convert the file to the
    primary supported input format (usually PostScript). To achieve this, 
    kdeprint uses the available filters (defined in XML files) and tries to
    build up a filter chain.
  * mime type checking: when building a filter chain, kdeprint checks that
    each output format is supported as an input by the next filter
  * possibility to specify input file from the print dialog in StandAlone
    mode (like XPP)
  * kmvirtualmanager.cpp: KMPrinter::Virtual is only set for pure virtual
    printers (== non empty instance name). This makes KPrinter::isVirtual()
    more useful.
  * CUPS plugin:
  	- support for quotas and user access restrictions (in wizard and
	  print manager)
	- added missing options in server configuration tool
  * Possibility to use an external preview program (still need a GUI to
    configure this).
  * print dialog: possibility to select the files to print in standalone
    mode (like XPP).

27/08/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * implementation of "Schedule" tab in print dialog for the CUPS plugin
    (job-hold-until attribute).
  * Printer aliases are now handled gracefully in the LPR plugin (they
    are actually discarded)
  * kprinter.cpp: implementation of setPrintProgram() as:
  	setOption("kde-isspecial", "1");
	setOption("kde-special-command", cmd);

28/08/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * implementation of KPrintAction, which provides a quick access to
    a class of printers (special, regular or both). An application just
    needs to create a KPrintAction anc connect to print(KPrinter*).

31/08/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * CUPS plugin: fix crash for Qt3 port, must check if attr->name is NULL
    before comparing it with strcmp or strncmp.

12/09/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * Management library: set all toolbars non movable to avoid move handles

13/09/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * CUPS plugin: fix multiple showing of password dialog for password-
    protected printers (timer is now blocked when the password dialog is
    shown)

14/09/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * CUPS plugin: configuration wizard rewritten using the structure of
    ESP PrintPro: more consistent, less pages and widgets. Not used as
    default config wizard yet.
  * QList -> QPtrList

25/09/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * CUPS plugin: made the new configuration wizard as default one.
  * other QList -> QPtrList fixes (commited to CVS)
  * Avoid to call plugin functions "completePrinter<xxx>" for pseudo
    printers (to not confuse the CUPS daemon for example)
  * Improved how the default printer is selected in print dialog to
    work in any cases
  * General: make use of KLocale::pageSize() to determine the default
    page size (used for example for pseudo printers and classes)
  * Wizard: fix buffer overflow when adding a remote LPD queue having
    a lot of jobs waiting

03/10/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * CUPS plugin: make use of GET/PUT request to handle configuration
    file. Possibility to admin a remote CUPS server (if allowed)
  * CUPS plugin: added "/jobs" in the available resources list

09/10/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * CUPS plugin: added 2 missing pages in stand-alone mode, "Image"
    and "Text".

10/10/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * CUPS plugin: "HP-GL/2" page added
  * General: added a GUI to configure the preview program, into the
    config dialog of the print manager

12/10/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * general: added the possibility for a plugin to add new actions
    to the toolbar and context menu (main use = export driver in
    CUPS).
  * CUPS plugin: added support to export driver to Windows client
    through samba. Threaded operation with progress bar to notify
    the user. Graphical equivalent to cupsaddsmb from cups-1.1.11.

16/10/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * CUPS plugin: removed the "file" backend as it doesn't seem to
    be available since a couple of releases, and added a "Other"
    page to the wizard for any third-party backend (like pdf).

18/10/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * kdeprintfax: don't hardcode program path, use the $PATH variable
    first to find the program. Default to /usr/bin if not found.

02/11/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * CUPS plugin:
  	. fix for remote printers when there's also a local
	  printer with the same name: the printer-uri-supported
	  is not used by default anymore
	. implementation of IPP report for installed printers
	  as well as detected IPP printers on the network (in
	  the wizard)

05/11/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * kdeprintfax: added possibility to view files being faxed and
    file action (remove and view) are enabled only when needed.
  * KPrinter: when printing to a file, support encoding and spaces
    in file names + system --> KProcess.

07/11/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * kdeprint: fixed some problems:
	. collate entirely handled by kdeprint, even in the case
	  of page selection on application-side.
	. set KPrinter object in KPrintDialog before adding other
	  dialog pages (some pages may need it)
  * wizard: changed button layout and added a side graphic. Not
    commited as the graphic comes from HP driver (copyright).

08/11/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * CUPS plugin:
  	. complete IPP report for job added
	. implementation of dynamically added plugin menus for
	  jobs in the job viewer (used for IPP report)
	. printer infos are now retrieved from the correct host
	  for remote printers and classes (idem for IPP report)
  * general: implementation of a DCOP signal communication to
    synchronize all kdeprint apps, a plugin change in one app is
    notified to all other opened apps (via DCOP).
  * kicker extension: made extension aware of plugin change in
    other apps (using new DCOP signal comm).

09/11/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * CUPS plugin: added the possibility to list jobs on remote
    printers. No management is allowed on remote jobs (yet?).

10/11/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * general: use KShellProcess::quote() for any quoting. Normally,
    all quoting problem should be fixed now.
    
12/11/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * CUPS: redesigned the "cups-add-smb" dialog to make it more
    user-driendly.

13/11/2001 Michael GOffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * general: implementation of a KActiveLabel class to embed active
    links in labels. Clicking on it "exec" the associated URL.
  * general: make use of KActiveLabel in the first page of the
    "add-printer" wizard.
  * CUPS: make use of KActiveLabel in the "cups-add-smb" wizard.
  * wizard: SMB printers with space in their name are now shown
    correctly when scanning the network (however it should be
    avoided as smbspool seems to be unable to handle it).

14/11/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * ioslave: uploaded new templates from Chris (which adds support
    for pseudo printers
  * manager: modified RootOnly message for better consistency between
    "root" and "administrator" concepts
  * print dialog: updated accels (general, Qt, copies and other CUPS
    pages)
  * print dialog:
  	. file selection: line edit -> listview
	. file selection made as print dialog page and inserted at
	  the same level than "Copies"
	. added hiding mechanism to make the dialog more compact
	  (show/hide button can probably be improved)

15/11/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * CUPS: drivers are now downloaded from the actual server for remote
    printers. This allows to have access to all options set for any
    printer (even remote ones). However remote printer's drivers are
    kept read-only.

16/11/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * print dialog: instances are now presented in a tree structure in
    the combo box -> cleaner view.
  * general: ported the use of a global instance file to 2.2 branch
    (file is /etc/cups/lpoptions).
  * CUPS: added support for Adobe PPD file compliance (foomatic will
    introduce them very soon in normal distributions), where numerical
    options are mapped into enum options. KDEPrint still uses the 
    numerical option and update the corresponding enum one with the
    closest value.

21/11/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * job viewer: clicking on 'x' button only hide the job viewer but
    doesn't quit the app. To quit, either use menu item (from window
    or system tray) or accel when job viewer is visible.
  * general: print preview has been embedded in a real dialog, so that
    it is always centered on its parent now. It also have the dialog
    buttons in title bar (no minimize).

23/11/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * job management: the job management has been re-engineered to follow
    the paradigm "1 window == 1 queue". There's still the possibility to
    view jobs for all printers within a single window. This should enhance
    the usability of job management tools (I hope).

26/11/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * job management: job type (active/completed) is now handled on a 
    printer basis instead of a global property of the manager. This allows
    different windows to show different job type, and also ease the 
    management of "All Printers" windows.
  * job management: sorting jobs on numerical values is fixed (ID,
    size, ...)
  * job management: added the possibility to customize (from the plugin)
    what's shown as job attributes. New attributes can be added. This
    will be used for priority support in CUPS plugin.
  * job management: re-engineered how dynamic plugin actions are handled
    internally to fix problems when dealing with several windows opened.
    This new mechanism should also be applied to print management dynamic
    actions (more consistent).

28/11/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * special printers: added the possibility to have configurable options
    in pseudo-printers. Options are described in an additional XML file
    (like filters) and configured through an "Advanced" tab in the property
    dialog. TODO: graphical configuration widget + apply KXmlCommand to
    normal filters.

29/11/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * general: fixed sorting of options in driver view. They should be shown
    in order of appearance now.
  * general: make use of the new KXmlCommand class for filters too.
  * filters: removed the "Page Size" from the options of enscript filter,
    this is taken from the KPrinter object now.

04/12/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * general: finalized the new XML command mechanism:
  	. graphical command builder
	. pseudo-printers and filters are completely based on new XML
	  object, though old style is supported (only requirements from
	  previous mechanism are not used).
	. KPrintFilter and KMFilterManager are now obsolete and replaced
	  by KXmlCommand and KXmlCommandManager respectively.
  * kdeprintfax: made the log window a "real" log window. It is dynamically
    refreshed on new debug output arrival (suggested by user).

10/12/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * general: make use of "Detail" mechanism of KDialogBase in XML command
    editor.

11/12/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * instances: for root, instances are saved in global file 
    /etc/cups/lpoptions. This allows to easily create global instances
    (just be root and create the instance).
  * pseudo-printers: for root, pseudo printers are saved in a global
    file, such that root is able to manage global pseudo printers. Locale
    pseudo printers still override global ones if they have the same name.

12/12/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * general: added error messages when the printer list cannot be retrieved
    in print manager and print dialog. With CUPS, if the server is not
    running, an error message is shown to the user.
  * CUPS: disabled all backends if no server is running.

13/12/2001 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * general: preleminary support for external printer tool. Only escputil
    at this moment.

03/01/2002 Michael Goffioul <goffioul@imec.be>
  * general:
  	. added a "ID name" label to the first dialog for command editing
	. put "View Printer Infos" in front of orientation and view type
	  change (more logical)
	. added a confirmation dialog before sending a test page to a
	  printer (printer and instance test)
	. added a short summary below the command selector containing the
	  ID and the output type ("not allowed" if no output supported).
	. added a WhatsThis help to the "Instances" tab briefly explaining
	  what's an instance.
