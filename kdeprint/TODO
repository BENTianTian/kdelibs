- Implement a generic banner behaviour: banners would be insrted
  as standard print file before and/or after the actual file. This
  would allow for KDE-specific banners and translated banners.

- Possibility to specify a different input slot for first page???

- change DCOP call of kdeprintd so that the command is a QStrList to
  avoid quoting problems.

- graphical configuration of basic print options:
	- default paper size (-> integrated into l10n)
	- default margins
	- preview program (-> done in config dialog)

- backport LPR plugin problem with aliases to 2.2 branch

- add "Subject" or "Regarding" to kdeprintfax interface: look first
  if this is possible in efax and/or hylafax

- allow the use of KPrinter object without the need for the print
  dialog: should use then default printer with default settings.

- add the possibility to view a printjob file (if possible)

- possibility of a generic "tiling" feature (coreldraw)

- CUPS: warn user if daemon not running

- CUPS: see if possible to retrieve remote jobs (as infos for
  remote printers)

- CUPS: support new PPD scheme where numerical options are mapped
  into enum ones for Adobe PPD compliance. When parsing a PPD file,
  an enum option should be dropped if a numerical one with the same
  name is found. When saving the PPD file, the enum should be set
  to the closest available value, and the real value should be set
  in the COMDATA line (as suggested by Till).
