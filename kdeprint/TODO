- Uses KDE language in IPP requests instead of standard CUPS
  language.

- Implement a generic banner behaviour: banners would be insrted
  as standard print file before and/or after the actual file. This
  would allow for KDE-specific banners and translated banners.

- Implement a check mechanism for filters, plugins and special
  printers.
