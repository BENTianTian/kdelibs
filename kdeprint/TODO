- Implement a generic banner behaviour: banners would be insrted
  as standard print file before and/or after the actual file. This
  would allow for KDE-specific banners and translated banners.

- Possibility to specify a different input slot for first page???

- make a backup of the CUPS config file before overwriting it
  -> use GET/PUT methods to handle CUPS config files

- change DCOP call of kdeprintd so that the command is a QStrList to
  avoid quoting problems.

- graphical configuration of basic print options:
	- default paper size
	- default margins
	- preview program
