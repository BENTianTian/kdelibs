BUGS
----

- CUPS: should continue working if unknown options are met:
	. issue a warning with list of options
	. make it able to restore those unknown option when
	  writing a new config file

WISHES
------

- Implement a generic banner behaviour: banners would be insrted
  as standard print file before and/or after the actual file. This
  would allow for KDE-specific banners and translated banners.

- Possibility to specify a different input slot for first page???

- add "Subject" or "Regarding" to kdeprintfax interface: look first
  if this is possible in efax and/or hylafax

- add the possibility to view a printjob file (if possible)

- possibility of a generic "tiling" feature (coreldraw)

- job option edition through graphical dialog (extract print options
  from request and rebuild a printer properties dialog)

- restarting server: use of "ps" in a subshell to get the pid, possibility
  of authentification (put this into separate program that would restart
  itself using kdesu).

- extension of the print ioslave to view jobs (print:/jobs)

- CUPS: you can tag any job when printing with an option like 
  "-o job-billing=#123abc" and the "#123abc" gets into 
  /var/log/cups/page_log for later accounting.
  * make this an option in the kprinter dialog
  * make the "job-billing" tag visible on the "Jobs" tab of the
    printmanager and in kjobviewer
  This would make a cool feature for professional and enterprise
  printing with KDEPrint				 -kp-

- CUPS: you can tag any job when printing with the option 
  "-o page-label=my_printjob". Then the string "my_printjob" gets
  printed onto top and bottom of every page. (This is overridden
  when on the server a "Classification" level is set...) This
  works on text and image files. It is not clear to me, if it 
  is also supposed to work for other kinds of input files.
  * make this an option in the kprinter dialog		 -kp-

- Put those 2 new options along with schedule attribute into
  a single "Advanced" tab
 
- CUPS: a "Printer/Server Debugging Helper" would be nice: you could 
  vary the LogLevel there, restart the server, provide a viewer
  for the error_log (maybe the other logs too) with life updates
  including means to "grep" for errors and keywords. It could even
  become extended to provide for some automatic reporting tool that
  collects the data to be send in for bug reports (like PPD in use,
  CUPS version, KDEPrint version, printer-make-and-modell, usage
  of foomatic/cupsomatic, ghostscript version etc.).	-kp-
