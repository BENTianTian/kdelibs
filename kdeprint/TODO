BUGS

- backport LPR plugin problem with aliases to 2.2 branch



WISHES
------

- Implement a generic banner behaviour: banners would be insrted
  as standard print file before and/or after the actual file. This
  would allow for KDE-specific banners and translated banners.

- Possibility to specify a different input slot for first page???

- add "Subject" or "Regarding" to kdeprintfax interface: look first
  if this is possible in efax and/or hylafax

- add the possibility to view a printjob file (if possible)

- possibility of a generic "tiling" feature (coreldraw)

- job option edition through graphical dialog (extract print options
  from request and rebuild a printer properties dialog)

- restarting server: use of "ps" in a subshell to get the pid, possibility
  of authentification (put this into separate program that would restart
  itself using kdesu).

- extension of the print ioslave to view jobs (print:/jobs)
