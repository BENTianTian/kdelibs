- Implement a generic banner behaviour: banners would be insrted
  as standard print file before and/or after the actual file. This
  would allow for KDE-specific banners and translated banners.

- Possibility to specify a different input slot for first page???

- change DCOP call of kdeprintd so that the command is a QStrList to
  avoid quoting problems.

- graphical configuration of basic print options:
	- default paper size (-> integrated into l10n)
	- default margins
	- preview program (-> done in config dialog)

- backport LPR plugin problem with aliases to 2.2 branch

- add "Subject" or "Regarding" to kdeprintfax interface: look first
  if this is possible in efax and/or hylafax

- allow the use of KPrinter object without the need for the print
  dialog: should use then default printer with default settings.

- add the possibility to view a printjob file (if possible)

- possibility of a generic "tiling" feature (coreldraw)

- CUPS: warn user if daemon not running

- support for job priority.

- make the log window of kdeprintfax a real log window (refreshing
  mechanism) -> has to be made a non temporary dialog as it is the
  case now.

- support for options in pseudo-printers (see bug #35305). This
  would imply:
  	. put pseudo-printer into XML file (like filter)
	. construct command-line from options
	. add "Options" tab in printer properties
