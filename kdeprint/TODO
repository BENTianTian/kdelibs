- Implement a generic banner behaviour: banners would be insrted
  as standard print file before and/or after the actual file. This
  would allow for KDE-specific banners and translated banners.

- Possibility to specify a different input slot for first page???

- make a backup of the CUPS config file before overwriting it
  -> use GET/PUT methods to handle CUPS config files

- change DCOP call of kdeprintd so that the command is a QStrList to
  avoid quoting problems.

- graphical configuration of basic print options:
	- default paper size
	- default margins
	- preview program

- avoid special characters and spaces in printer name, or at least
  warn the user and propose to strip all these chars.

- backport LPR plugin problem with aliases to 2.2 branch

- add "Subject" or "Regarding" to kdeprintfax interface: look first
  if this is possible in efax and/or hylafax

- have a look at new CUPS feature (1.2.0) for exporting PPD drivers
  through samba-2.2 (see cupsaddsmb).

- make use of KLocale::pageSize() to get default page size

- allow the use of KPrinter object without the need for the print
  dialog: should use then default printer with default settings.

- add the possibility to view a printjob file (if possible)

- redesign the CUPS config wizard to get a more consistent and cleaner
  interface (inspired by PrintPro interface)
