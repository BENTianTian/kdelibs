- Uses KDE language in IPP requests instead of standard CUPS
  language.

- Implement a generic banner behaviour: banners would be insrted
  as standard print file before and/or after the actual file. This
  would allow for KDE-specific banners and translated banners.

- Use another tool for preview (maybe difficult to know if we want to
  continue or not)

- Possibility to specify a different input slot for first page???

- make use global instance file

- make a backup of the CUPS config file before overwriting it

- change DCOP call of kdeprintd so that the command is a QStrList to
  avoid quoting problems.

- integration of some features into kicker "start" menu
