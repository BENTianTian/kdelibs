BUGS
----

- move print manager module from "Peripherals" back to "System"
  in KControl

- Administration of remote printers: driver settings

- Allow to view a set of specified printers in the job viewer
  (instead of "one or all").

- LPRng: should create a PPD file for Foomatic and add the field
  ppdfile=/etc/foomatic/<queue_name>.ppd to the printcap entry (for
  use with gpr)

- optimize PPD files parsing: don't parse the whole file, just
  stop when you got everything.

- kdeprintfax improvement related to Hylafax:
	. -f %name doesn't make sense, it should be -f %email instead
	. add -n to the default command
	. think about possibility to schedule the fax sending using
	  the -a <time> flag
	. add the possibility to add fax numbers to the ab instead of
	  simply saying there's no fax number

- CUPS: RIPCache: Unlimited should be changed into 8m. Also add a combo
  for the suffix such that any size can be set: [1,100] {k,m,g,t}

- Help buttons for "kprinter" and the wizard


WISHES
------

- Implement a generic banner behaviour: banners would be insrted
  as standard print file before and/or after the actual file. This
  would allow for KDE-specific banners and translated banners.

- Possibility to specify a different input slot for first page???

- add "Subject" or "Regarding" to kdeprintfax interface: look first
  if this is possible in efax and/or hylafax

- add the possibility to view a printjob file (if possible)

- possibility of a generic "tiling" feature (coreldraw)

- fix the problem of page range in job edition dialog (CUPS)

- restarting server: use of "ps" in a subshell to get the pid, possibility
  of authentification (put this into separate program that would restart
  itself using kdesu).

- extension of the print ioslave to view jobs (print:/jobs)

- CUPS: a "Printer/Server Debugging Helper" would be nice: you could 
  vary the LogLevel there, restart the server, provide a viewer
  for the error_log (maybe the other logs too) with life updates
  including means to "grep" for errors and keywords. It could even
  become extended to provide for some automatic reporting tool that
  collects the data to be send in for bug reports (like PPD in use,
  CUPS version, KDEPrint version, printer-make-and-modell, usage
  of foomatic/cupsomatic, ghostscript version etc.).	-kp-

- CUPS: add a generic table view as the print dialog to set arbitrary
  options (useful to "tag" a specified job, and this doesn't affect
  the CUPS process).
