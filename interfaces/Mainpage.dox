/** @mainpage Interfaces
*
* This section collects interfaces that can be implemented
* by applications. The interfaces provide well-defined functionality
* and make it possible to substitute one application (that implements
* a given interface) for another.
*
* Documented interfaces are:
*
* - KSpeech - The KDE Text-to-Speech API.
* - Terminal
* - KTextEditor
*
