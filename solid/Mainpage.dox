 *
 * And for HAL's sake, each mistake, ah, you forgave
 * And soon both of us learned to trust
 * Not run away, it was no time to play
 * We build it up and build it up and committed it
 *  
 * And now it's solid
 * Solid as a rock
 * That's what this code is
 * That's what we've got, oh, mmm?
 *  
 * Solid (Oh)
 * Solid as a rock
 * And nothing's changed it (Ooh)
 * The code is still hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
