List of remaining conflicts between kdelibs3 and kdelibs4

bin/cupsdconf    (where is it launched? looks like it's dlopened)
bin/cupsdoprint -> libexec
bin/kaddprinterwizard (where is it launched!?) -> libexec
bin/kde-menu
bin/kded
bin/kdesu_stub
bin/ktradertest            -> only needed for xdg utils and debugging... -> ktradertest4?
                              kdebase/runtime will be installed as well, so it can't conflict with kdelibs3 either...
bin/kdostartupconfig       -> libexec
bin/kstartupconfig         -> libexec

bin/kcookiejar        (not used by khtml anymore, only a command-line tool) -> kcookiejar4 - DONE
bin/kio_http_cache_cleaner -> libexec - DONE
bin/kdontchangethehostname -> libexec - DONE
bin/klauncher              -> libexec - DONE
bin/kpac_dhcp_helper       -> libexec - DONE
bin/ksendbugmail           -> libexec - DONE
bin/kconf_update (started by kded) -> libexec - DONE

bin/ksvgtopng              -> devel only, doesn't matter
bin/kunittestmodrunner     -> devel only, and for compat so it can't be renamed/moved
bin/makekdewidgets         -> devel only, doesn't matter
bin/kconfig_compiler       -> devel only, doesn't matter
bin/preparetips            -> devel only perhaps?
