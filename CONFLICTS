List of remaining conflicts between kdelibs3 and kdelibs4

bin/cupsdconf    (where is it launched? looks like it's dlopened by kmcupsmanager.cpp but the binary is now useless)
bin/kde-menu               -> user tool (debugging, scripts, GUI feedback after install) -> kde-menu4? kde4-menu?
bin/cupsdoprint            -> libexec. Warning, add a KStandardDirs::findExe in KCupsPrinterImpl::setupCommand.
bin/kstartupconfig         -> kstartupconfig4 and move to kdebase - it's called by startkde
bin/kdostartupconfig       -> libexec ideally, but the problem is the system("kdostartupconfig") calls in kstartupconfig.cpp (C code)
                              so it would be simpler to just make it kdostartupconfig4.

List of solved conflicts:

bin/ktradertest            -> kdebase/runtime/ktraderclient
                              Note that kdebase/runtime will be installed as well, so it can't conflict with kdelibs3 either.

bin/kded                   -> kded4 - DONE
bin/kcookiejar             -> kcookiejar4 - DONE (not used by khtml anymore, only a command-line tool)

bin/kdesu_stub             -> libexec - DONE
bin/kaddprinterwizard      -> libexec - DONE (started by a kicker menuext; wrapper around libkdeprint functionality)
bin/kio_http_cache_cleaner -> libexec - DONE
bin/kdontchangethehostname -> libexec - DONE
bin/klauncher              -> libexec - DONE

bin/ksendbugmail           -> libexec - DONE
bin/kconf_update           -> libexec - DONE (started by kded)

bin/ksvgtopng              -> devel only, doesn't matter
bin/kunittestmodrunner     -> devel only, and for compat so it can't be renamed/moved
bin/makekdewidgets         -> devel only, doesn't matter
bin/kconfig_compiler       -> devel only, doesn't matter
bin/preparetips            -> devel only perhaps?
