List of remaining conflicts between kdelibs3 and kdelibs4

bin/cupsdconf    (where is it launched? looks like it's dlopened)
bin/cupsdoprint -> libexec
bin/imagetops
bin/kaddprinterwizard (where is it launched!?) -> libexec
bin/kconf_update      (started by kded) -> libexec
bin/kconfig_compiler  -> libexec - DONE
bin/kcookiejar        (not used by khtml anymore, only a command-line tool) -> kcookiejar4 - DONE
bin/kde-menu
bin/kded
bin/kdesu_stub
bin/kdontchangethehostname -> libexec
bin/kio_http_cache_cleaner -> libexec
bin/klauncher              -> libexec - DONE
bin/kpac_dhcp_helper       -> libexec - DONE
bin/ksendbugmail           -> libexec - DONE
bin/kdostartupconfig       -> libexec
bin/kstartupconfig         -> libexec
bin/ksvgtopng              -> devel only, doesn't matter
bin/ktradertest            -> only needed for xdg utils and debugging... -> ktradertest4?
                              kdebase/runtime will be installed as well, so it can't conflict with kdelibs3 either...
bin/kunittestmodrunner
bin/makekdewidgets         -> devel only, doesn't matter
bin/preparetips            -> devel only perhaps?
