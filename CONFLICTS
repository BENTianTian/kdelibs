List of remaining conflicts between kdelibs3 and kdelibs4

bin/cupsdconf    (where is it launched? looks like it's dlopened)
bin/kdesu_stub
bin/kde-menu               -> user tool (debugging, scripts, GUI feedback after install) -> kde-menu4? kde4-menu?
bin/ktradertest            -> only needed for xdg utils and debugging... -> ktradertest4?
                              kdebase/runtime will be installed as well, so it can't conflict with kdelibs3 either...
