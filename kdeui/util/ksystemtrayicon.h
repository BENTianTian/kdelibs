/**
 * \brief %KDE System Tray Window class
 *
 * This class implements system tray windows.
 *
 * A tray window is a small window (typically 24x24 pixel) that docks
 * into the system tray in the desktop panel. It usually displays an
 * icon or an animated icon there. The icon represents
 * the application, similar to a taskbar button, but consumes less
 * screen space.
 *
 * When the user clicks with the left mouse button on the icon, the
 * main application window is shown/raised and activated. With the
 * right mouse button, she gets a popupmenu with application specific
 * commands, including "Minimize/Restore" and "Quit".
