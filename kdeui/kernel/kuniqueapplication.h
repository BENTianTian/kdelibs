 * Please note that this supports only one instance per KDE session. If
 * your application can only be opened once per user or once per host, you
 * need to ensure this independently of KUniqueApplication.
 *
 * If another instance
 * is started, it will determine (via DBUS) whether it is the first instance
 * or a second instance.  If it is a second instance, it will forward on
 * the information to the first instance and then quit.
 *
 * The .desktop file for the application should state X-DBUS-StartupType=Unique,
 * see ktoolinvocation.h
 *
 * If your application is used to open files, it should also support the --tempfile
 * option (see KCmdLineArgs::addTempFileOption()), to delete tempfiles after use.
 * Add X-KDE-HasTempFileOption=true to the .desktop file to indicate this.
