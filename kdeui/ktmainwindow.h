/**
 * Top level widget that provides toolbars, a status line and a frame.
 *
 * It should be used as a top level (parent-less) widget.
 * It manages the geometry for all its children, including your
 * main widget.
 *
 * Normally, you will inherit from KTMainWindow (known also as KTMW),
 * then construct (or use some existing) widget as
 * your main view. You can set only one main view.
 *
 * You can add as many toolbars as you like. There can be only one menubar
 * and only one statusbar.
 *
 * The toolbars, menubar, and statusbar can be created by the
 * KTMainWindow and - unlike the old KTMainWindow - may, but do not
 * have to, be deleted by you. KTMainWindow will handle that internally.
 *
 * Height and width can be operated independently from each other. Simply
 * define the minimum/maximum height/width of your main widget and
 * KTMainWindow will take this into account. For fixed size windows set
 * your main widget to a fixed size.
 *
 * Fixed aspect ratios (heightForWidth()) and fixed width widgets are
 * not supported.
 *
 * KTMainWindow will set icon, mini icon and caption, which it gets
 * from @ref KApplication. It provides full session management, and
 * will save its position, geometry and positions of toolbars and
 * menubar on logout. If you want to save additional data, reimplement
 * @ref saveProperties() and (to read them again on next login) @ref
 * readProperties(). To save special data about your data, reimplement
 * @ref saveGlobalProperties(). To warn user that application or
 * windows have unsaved data on close or logout, reimplement @ref
 * queryClose() and/or @ref queryExit().
 *
 * There is also a macro RESTORE which can restore all your windows
 * on next login.
 *
 * KTMainWindow might be replaced/extended in the future to
 * KMainWindow which will be a child of @ref QMainWindow. Anyway,
 * the current interface will be supported for compatibility
 * reasons.
 *
 *  Note that a KTMainWindow per-default is created with the
 *  WDestructiveClose flag, i.e. it is automatically destroyed when the
 *  window is closed. If you do not want this behavior, specify 0 as
 *  widget flag in the constructor.
