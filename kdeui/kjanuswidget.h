/**
 * This class provides a number of ready to use layouts (faces). It is used 
 * as an internal widget in @ref KDialogBase, but can also used as a 
 * widget of its own. 
 *
 * It provides TreeList, Tabbed, Plain and Swallow layouts. 
 * 
 * The TreeList face provides a list in the left area and pages in the 
 * right. The area are separated by a movable splitter. The look is somewhat
 * similar to the layout in the Control Center. A page is raised by 
 * selecting the corresponding tree list item.
 *
 * The Tabbed face is a common tabbed widget. The procedure for creating a 
 * page is similar for creating a TreeList. This has the advantage that if
 * your widget contain too many pages it is trivial to convert it into a 
 * TreeList. Just change the face in the @ref KJanusWidget constructor to
 * KJanusWidget::TreeList and you have a tree list layout instead.
 *
 * The Plain face provided an empty widget (QFrame) where you can place your
 * widgets. The KJanusWidget makes no assumptions regarding the contents so
 * you are free to add whatever you want.
 *
 * The Swallow face is provided in order to simplify the usage of existing
 * widgets and to allow changing the visible widget. You specify the widget
 * to be displayed by @ref setSwallowedWidget . Your widget will be 
 * reparented inside the widget. You can specify a Null (0) widget. A empty
 * space is then displayed.
 *
 * For all modes it is important that you specify the @ref QWidget::minimumSize
 * on the page, plain widget or the swallowed widget. This size is used
 * when the KJanusWidget determines its own minimum size. You get the latter
 * minimum size by using the @ref minimumSizeHint method.
 *
 * To be continued...
 *
 * @short Easy to used widget with many layouts
