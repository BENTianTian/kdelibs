TODO-List for the KFileDialog and associated classes (in order of importance)

- Multi-selection
- fix ordering of items in detailed view (QListView orders itself)
- save all properties of KFileDialog in kdeglobals and restore
- use KComboBox
- fix file:/ prefix missing by default
- make use of KAction for Toolbar-actions and Popupmenu
- make popupmenu extensible (via KAction)
- make popupmenu off-switchable
- history of last files/dirs
- add ~/Desktop to default-dir combo
- show icons in combos
- implement in-place editing in all views
- make a simple fileview based on QListBox
- drag&drop support for the views (somehow into baseclass KFileView?)
- make use of KRemoteFile?

- test, fix, implement KURLEdit (and give it a better name ;)

If anyone wants to implement some of those, please do. In case of questions,
don't hesitate to ask me.
