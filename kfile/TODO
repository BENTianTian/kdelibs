TODO-List for the KFileDialog and associated classes (in order of importance)

- Multi-selection
- save all properties of KFileDialog in kdeglobals and restore
  (add KDirOperator::saveProperties( KConfig * ) and readProperties())
- use KComboBox
- fix file:/ prefix missing by default
- KFileView::setCurrentItem() / highlight() ?!?!
- KFileView::setSelected( const QRegExp& )
- remember directory when entering it, when coming back, set it as current
- history of last files/dirs
- flag for local files only (or what about KRemoteFile?)
- add private d struct everywhere
- separate KDirOperator, location-combo, filter-combo etc. from KFileDialog
  to another widget (everything besides OK/Cancel buttons).
- add ~/Desktop to default-dir combo
  (partly have that on my hdd, but that has to be completely reorganized)
- show icons in combos
- implement in-place editing (rename) + make it configurable in all views
- make a simple fileview based on QListBox
- drag&drop support for the views (somehow into baseclass KFileView?)

- test, fix, implement KURLEdit (and give it a better name (KFileRequester?))

If anyone wants to implement some of those, please do. In case of questions,
don't hesitate to ask me.
