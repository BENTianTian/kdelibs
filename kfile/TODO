TODO-List for the KFileDialog and associated classes (in order of importance)

- Multi-selection
- save all properties of KFileDialog in kdeglobals and restore
- use KComboBox
- fix file:/ prefix missing by default
- make use of KAction for Toolbar-actions and Popupmenu
  (hmm, I already have this on my hdd, dunno if this is the Right Way(TM) tho)
- make popupmenu extensible (via KAction)
  (yup, already on my hdd)
- make popupmenu off-switchable
  (yup, dirOperator->actionMenu->setEnabled( false ) should do it (on my hdd))
- history of last files/dirs
- separate KDirOperator, location-combo, filter-combo etc. from KFileDialog
  to another widget (everything besides OK/Cancel buttons).
- add ~/Desktop to default-dir combo
  (partly have that on my hdd, but that has to be completely reorganized)
- show icons in combos
- implement in-place editing in all views
- make a simple fileview based on QListBox
- drag&drop support for the views (somehow into baseclass KFileView?)
- make use of KRemoteFile?

- test, fix, implement KURLEdit (and give it a better name (KFileRequester?)

If anyone wants to implement some of those, please do. In case of questions,
don't hesitate to ask me.
