TODO-List for the KFileDialog and associated classes (in order of importance)

- fix item-limit in KDircomboBox
- make directory following configurable
- fix infinite loop in mergeLists
- compare check for ".." -> always first!
- signal KFileView::selectionCleared()
- check ExistingFiles and OnlyLocal flags
- use KComboBox
- KFileView::setCurrentItem() / highlight() ?!?!
- KFileView::setSelected( const QRegExp& )
- implement KFile::PreviewInfo
- remember directory when entering it, when coming back, set it as current
- what about KRemoteFile?
- add private d struct everywhere
- separate KDirOperator, location-combo, filter-combo etc. from KFileDialog
  to another widget (everything besides OK/Cancel buttons).
- implement in-place editing (rename) + make it configurable in all views
- make a simple fileview based on QListBox
- drag&drop support for the views (somehow into baseclass KFileView?)

- test, fix, implement KURLEdit (and give it a better name (KFileRequester?))

If anyone wants to implement some of those, please do. In case of questions,
don't hesitate to ask me.
