Description: aRts Sound system
 aRts is a short form for "analog realtime synthesizer". The idea of the whole
 thing is to create/process sound using small modules which do certain tasks.
 These may be create a waveform (oscillators), play samples, filter data, add
 signals, perform effects like delay/flanger/chorus, or output the data to
 the soundcard.

 aRts is the core sound system for KDE (and other systems)
