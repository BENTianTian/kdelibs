Name=Nepomuk Representation Language
Comment=NRL is a Representational Language that addresses certain limitations on the part of RDF/S. It is itself designed on top of RDF. In particular it includes support for Named Graphs for modularization of data. Although being a widely-popular notion, named graphs have not been supported by any Representational Language so far. It is also based on a view concept for the tailoring of ontologies. This view concept turned out to be of additional value, as it also provides a mechanism to impose different semantics on the same syntactical structure.
