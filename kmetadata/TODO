* Make sure unmodified resources are not loaded during syncing (otherwise a sync of one
  simple change might trigger a big reload). This can probably be solved by making the 
  resource identifier a special field like the type so setting it does not mark the
  resource as modified.
* Add support for multiple types (Merge multiple types in one hierarchy branch?)
* rcgen: Add the possibility to specify multiple ontology files in one run.
