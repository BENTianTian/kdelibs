To (try to) compile kdelibs with CMake, you will need:

kdelibs trunk
CMake version 2.3.4 or later 



WHERE TO GET CMAKE
==================

Sources are at:

http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.3/cmake-2.3.4-20060317.tar.gz

unpack, run "./configure && make && make install" will install into /usr/local.

Ensure cmake is in your $PATH.

(I don't think you even need to do this, but it makes some sense:
Ensure you run 'unsermake clean' first in all your KDE source directories.)

Use a separate builddir to build KDE modules, not the sourcedir.

To get regular debugging, pass -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug
To get full debugging, pass -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debugfull

If something hasn't been found, use "cd builddir; ccmake sourcedir" to set the 
missing (or wrong) things manually.

Short example:
% cd
% mkdir build-kdelibs
% cd build-kdelibs
% cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/KDE-4.0 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debugfull /path/to/kdelibs/sources
% make
% make install


If you prefer XCode projects, KDevelop projects or Visual Studio projects
over Makefiles, run cmake with the appropriate generator: cmake . -GKDevelop3
etc.


DOCUMENTATION:
-read the cmake manpage
-visit http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Documentation.html and go through the
contents you find there, start with "Writing CMakeLists.txt".
-visit the cmake wiki at http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake, it contains
a lot of useful information.
