To (try to) compile kdelibs with CMake, you will need:

kdelibs trunk
CMake version 2.3.3 or later 
	See: http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde-core-devel&m=113961367432246&w=2



WHERE TO GET CMAKE
==================

Sources are at:

http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.3/cmake-2.3.3-20060210.tar.gz

unpack, run "cmake ." , run your make (make, gmake, nmake).

If something hasn't been found, use ccmake . to set the missing things
manually.

If you prefer XCode projects, KDevelop projects or Visual Studio projects
over Makefiles, run cmake with the appropriate generator: cmake . -GKDevelop3
etc.


DOCUMENTATION:
-read the cmake manpage
-visit http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Documentation.html and go through the
contents you find there, start with "Writing CMakeLists.txt".
Don't miss out the cmake Wiki, it contains a lot of useful information.
