== Kross TODO ==

Always valid:
* more performance
* more documentations, tutorials, examples, ...
* more unittests

Core:
* refactor Action::functionNames and Action::callFunction to offer the
  functions a script provides either as KActionCollection where each
  function is a KAction or let Action dynamicly build slots where
  each slot represents a function.

Modules:
* add KStandardDirs-module to be able to reuse e.g. the resource-stuff
  from within all scripts without much pain.
* add KPart module to optional load KPart's.
* make ScriptManager more configurable + reusable
* extend forms, e.g. with a wizard?!

Ruby:
* support access to the QObject-hierachy. That means each RubyExtension
  used to wrap a QObject instance should provide access to the child
  QObject instances the wrapped QObject has.
* support access to the Kross::Manager (global) and Kross::Action (self/this)
  instances if not done already?!
* reimplement connect signal<=>slot support
* add better dynamic Korundum integration (e.g. trade QObject-instances
  around between QtRuby and Kross).

Python:
* uncomment dynamic PyQt-support + regressiontest just every case

KjsEmbed:
* fix longlong segfault
* fix ulonglong segfault
* fix QByteArray
* implement QVariantMap
* test/extend QVariant
* test/extend propertymembers
* test/extend propertymethods
* test/extend enumerators
* test/extend signals and slots
* extend KjsEmbed to be able to deal with untrusted scripts coming from
  untrusted sources like e.g. via internet distributed OpenDocument files.
