/** QueuePolicy is an interface for customizations of the queueing behaviour
    of sets of jobs.

    A job can have a queueing policy assigned. In that case, the job is only
    executed when the method canRun() of the assigned policy returns true. For
    every call to canRun() that returns true, it is guaranteed that the method
    free() or the method release() is called. Calling free() means the job has
    been executed, while calling release() means the job was not executed for
    external reasons, and will be retried later on.

    As an example, dependencies can be implemented using a QueuePolicy:
    canRun() returns true when the job has no unresolved dependencies. free()
    and release() are empty.

    A job can have multiple queue policies assigned, and will only be executed
    if all of them return true from canRun() within the same execution attempt.
    Jobs only keep a reference to the QueuePolicy. Therefore, the same object
    can be assigned to multiple jobs and this way control the way all those
    jobs are executed. Jobs never assume ownership of their assigned queue
    policies.
