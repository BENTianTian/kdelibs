This document is our own "Request for Comments". We list ideas here on how to
improve ThreadWeaver and discuss them. You can also vote on them by adding or
removing a star in front of the text after the bullet like this: 
- *** job priorities
=============================>--------------------<==========================

- * job priorities
- * job categories
- thread scheduling priorities on the OS scheduler level (may actually not
  work on Linux)
- cancellation of dependant jobs if a dependancy raises an error
  (all-or-nothing)
- JobSequence objects (a queue of Jobs that will be executed in order,
  automatically sets up deps)
- * virtual aboutToBeQueued method for jobs (allows jobs to queue subjobs
  before themselves)
