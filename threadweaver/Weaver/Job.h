	It is essential for the ThreadWeaver library that as a kind of
        convention, the different creators of Job objects do not touch the
        protected data members of the Job until somehow notified by the
        Job.

	Also, please note that Jobs may not be executed twice. Create two
	different objects to perform two consecutive or parallel runs.

	Jobs may declare dependancies. If Job B depends on Job A, B may not be
	executed before A is finished.

            method to abort a Job processing. Not even a default boolean flag

            will need to create an exit event.
            You have to reimplement the method to actually initiate an abort
            action.
            The method is not pure virtual because users are not supposed to
            be forced to always implement requestAbort().
