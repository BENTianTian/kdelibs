        convention, the different creators of Job objects do not touch the
        protected data members of the Job until somehow notified by the
        Job.

	Also, please note that Jobs may not be executed twice. Create two
	different objects to perform two consecutive or parallel runs.

	Jobs may declare dependencies. If Job B depends on Job A, B may not be
	executed before A is finished. To learn about dependencies, see
	DependencyPolicy.

            If a job fails (success() returns false), it will *NOT* resolve
            it's dependencies when it finishes. This will make sure that Jobs
            that depend on the failed job will not be started.

            There is an important gotcha: When a Job object is deleted, it
            will always resolve it's dependencies. If dependent jobs should
            not be executed after a failure, it is important to dequeue those
            befor deleting the failed Job.

            A JobSequence may be helpful for that purpose.

            Please note that the default implementation of the method does
            nothing (!). This is due to the fact that there is no generic
            method to abort a Job processing. Not even a default boolean flag
            makes sense, as Job could, for example, be in an event loop and
            will need to create an exit event.
            You have to reimplement the method to actually initiate an abort
            action.
            The method is not pure virtual because users are not supposed to
            be forced to always implement requestAbort().
            Also, this method is supposed to return immidiately, not after the
            abort has completed. It requests the abort, the Job has to act on
            the request. */

            thread holds a lock on the weaver's queue. Therefore, it is save
            to assume that recursive queueing is atomic from the queues
