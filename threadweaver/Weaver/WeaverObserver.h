    /** Observers provides signals on different weaver events that are
        otherwise only available through objects of different classes
        (threads, jobs). Usually, access to the signals of those objects
        is not provided through the weaver API. Use an observer to reveice
        notice, for example, on thread activity.

        To unregister, simply delete the observer.

        When using WeaverObservers, it is recommended to create and delete
        Jobs only in the controlling (usually the main) thread. Also, it is
        better to use deleteLater(..), as Job pointers are passed around in
        signals.
