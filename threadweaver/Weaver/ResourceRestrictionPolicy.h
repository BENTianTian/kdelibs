    /** ResourceRestrictionPolicy is used to limit the number of concurrent accesses to the same resource.

    If a set of Jobs accesses a resource that can be overloaded, this may
    degrade application performance. For example, loading too many files
    from the hard disc at the same time may lead to longer load times.
    ResourceRestrictionPolicy can be used to cap the number of
    accesses. Resource restriction policies are shared between the
    affected jobs. All jobs that share a resurce restriction policy have
    to acquire permission from the policy before they can run. In this
    way, resource restrictions can be compared to semaphores, only that
    they require no locking at the thread level.

    The SMIV example uses a resource restriction to limit the number of
    images files that are loaded from the disk at the same time.
