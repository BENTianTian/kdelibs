The development of ThreadWeaver for Qt3 has been stopped, since it will not be
useable as-is with Qt4. A Qt4 port will be incorporated here. The Qt4 port
will supposedly be portable to all Qt target platforms. 

If you need to use ThreadWeaver, but not develop it, you still may go ahead,
as the API is not intended to change (much). A later port should be trivial.
