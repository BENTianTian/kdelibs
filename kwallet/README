This directory consists of two libraries: kwalletbackend and kwalletclient

KWallet::Backend makes use of KWalletClient.

KWallet::Backend is used inside kded to manage the actual files and
encryption.  On the other hand, KWallet::Wallet is used to represent
wallet entries and to encapsulate communication to and from the
wallet server inside kded.


Application level:

KSystemTray notifier for wallet accesses

Konqueror plugin

KControl module

Manager (perhaps just a way to load the KControl module quickly?)
