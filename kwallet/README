This directory consists of two libraries: kwalletbackend and kwalletclient


KWalletBackend makes use of KWalletClient.

KWalletBackend is used inside kdesud to manage the actual files and
encryption.  On the other hand, KWalletClient is used to represent
wallet entries and to encapsulate communication to and from the
wallet server inside kdesud.


Application level:

KSystemTray notifier for wallet accesses

Konqueror plugin

KControl module

Manager (perhaps just a way to load the KControl module quickly?)
