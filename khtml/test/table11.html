This page is a testcase for a overlapping-image-problem as
seen on <a href="http://www.download.com">www.download.com</a>
<form>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="konqi.gif" width="240" height="320" alt="Konqi" hspace="50"></td>
    <td>
    The image to the left has a hspace=&quot;50&quot; attribute that fails to
    update the cell width and makes this text overlap the image.
    </td>
  </tr>
