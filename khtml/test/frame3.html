This frame is a testcase for a problem with bogus HTML as seen
on <a href="http://www.irt.de/IRT/indexaktuelles.htm" target="_top">http://www.irt.de/IRT/indexaktuelles.htm</a>
</p>
<p>
The frameset has a rows=&quot;100,100%&quot; attribute that
causes this frame including its vertical scrollbar to exceed the main window.
</p>
<p>
To demonstrate this, here follows some random text to get the frame a scrollbar.

This document specifies HTML 4.01, which is part of the HTML 4 line of specifications.
The first version of HTML 4 was HTML 4.0 [HTML40], published on 18 December 1997 and
revised 24 April 1998. This specification is the first HTML 4.01 Recommendation. It
includes non-editorial changes since the 24 April version of HTML 4.0. There have been
some changes to the DTDs, for example. This document obsoletes previous versions of HTML 4.0,
although W3C will continue to make those specifications and their DTDs available at the W3C Web site.
</p>
<p>
This document has been reviewed by W3C Members and other interested parties and has been
endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable document and may be
used as reference material or cited as a normative reference from another document.
W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and
to promote its widespread deployment. This enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web.
</p>
<p>
W3C recommends that user agents and authors (and in particular, authoring tools) produce
HTML 4.01 documents rather than HTML 4.0 documents. W3C recommends that authors produce
HTML 4 documents instead of HTML 3.2 documents. For reasons of backward compatibility,
W3C also recommends that tools interpreting HTML 4 continue to support HTML 3.2 and HTML 2.0 as well.
</p>
<p>
For information about the next generation of HTML, "The Extensible HyperText Markup Language" [XHTML],
please refer to the W3C HTML Activity and the list of W3C Technical Reports.
This document has been produced as part of the W3C HTML Activity.
The goals of the HTML Working Group (Members only) are discussed in the HTML Working Group charter (Members only).
