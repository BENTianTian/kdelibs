* DOM- and HTML-bindings

* Date.*, String.*, Number.* and RegExp.*

* modularize the extensions and load them on demand only (dlopen()) 

* automatic semi-colon insertion

* check if -0 support is really possible

* clean up the mess in the KJSO class. ECMAScript requires its own runtime
  type information which lead to this bloated construct at the first
  implementation attempt. Create a nicer hierarchy of derived classes.

* consider rewriting the lexer with (f)lex. The automatic semi-colon
  insertion and Unicode stopped me from doing it this way so far.

* idea for speed optimization: place the AST nodes in a block of pre-allocated
  memory instead of calling `new' each time. Same holds true for objects
  created during runtime.
