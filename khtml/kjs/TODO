* implement hundreds of missing functions

* take care of memory leaks

* check if NaN, Inf and -0 support is really possible

* clean up the mess in the KJSO class. ECMAScript requires its own runtime
  type information which lead to this bloated construct at the first
  implementation attempt. Create a nicer hierarchy of derived classes.

* consider rewriting the lexer with (f)lex. The automatic semi-colon
  insertion and Unicode stopped me from doing it this way so far.

* idea for speed optimization: place the AST nodes in a block of pre-allocated
  memory instead of calling `new' each time.
