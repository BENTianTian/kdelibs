KJS is yet another attempt to provide KDE with JavaScript support.

At first I'll mainly concentrate on implementing features specified in
ECMA 262. This standard describes ECMAScript aka JavaScript. The code is
plastered with ECMA x.y.z comments referring to the respective chapter of
that paper. You'll find it on http://www.ecma.ch.

The major work coming later will be to implement all the bindings needed
for integration with the KHTML widget's DOM and the support of all the nifty
features to control the browser known from Netscape et al.

Don't worry if you get the following warnings during compile. They are
expected and harmless.

grammar.y contains 1 shift/reduce conflict.
object.cpp:27: warning: division by zero in `0x000000000000000000000000 / 0.'
object.cpp:28: warning: division by zero in `0x00000000000000000080ff3f / 0.'

It's certainly too early for any bug reports.
