KJS is yet another attempt to provide KDE with JavaScript support.

At first I'll mainly concentrate on implementing features specified in
ECMA 262. This standard describes ECMAScript aka JavaScript. The code is
plastered with ECMA x.y.z comments referring to the respective chapter of
that paper. You'll find it on http://www.ecma.ch.
At the current stage most of the core is implemented. There's an ECMA 2
draft out there that will involve some modifications.

The major work coming later will be to implement all the bindings needed
for integration with the KHTML widget's DOM and the support of all the nifty
features to control the browser known from Netscape et al. This will require
support for so-called "host objects" which have a slightly different behaviour
than native objects.

Since further extensions are possible (DOP support etc.) these should be
grouped into modules. The modules will be loaded and initialized on demand
only (keyword: dlopen). This way we should be able to limit memory usage to
reasonable size while allowing arbritary extensions.   

Without the HTML bindings there's not much sense in activating JS support in
konqueror. If you would like to play with the interpreter right now you may
use `testkjs'. Simply type `make test' in this directory and pass a plain
JavaScript file to the engine. Example: `./testkjs test.js'.
