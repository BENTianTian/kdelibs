Here's what's still missing (roughly in order of importance):

* check the remaining ascii() calls

* move the attribute parsing into the objects

* simplify the KHTMLWidget/KHTMLView api, perhaps add a widget, which
  is almost a browser (move some stuff from konqueror here...)

* use KURL instead of QString url everywhere for URL's. This
  would avoid quite some QString<-->KURL conversions

* many functions using QString now could be changed to use references,
  to avoid copying of the string

* move the parsing of table tags into the main parser

* get rid of the blockingTokens in the tokenizer

* incremental table layout

* make the object tree reflect the real document structure.
  Needed for dynamic html

* perhaps split up htmlobj.* into several files

* charset support (--> kcharsets)

* some html-4 elements are still not supported

* add (use) more attributes

* BiDi support

* jscript

* java
