Here's what's still missing (without order):

Rendering:
	* text-align: Justify missing
	* more thorough checks of reordering/line width calculations
	  in a BiDi context

General:
	* move all internal classes into namespace khtml
	* KHTMLWidget::enableImages()
	* find()
	* ad filter

StyleSheets:
	* @ rules in sheets
	* lots of properties
	* html style attribute does only parse the first property
	* delete the old cssproperties in a style attribute in case
	  the style attribute changes.

DOM:
	* some functions in the Impl classes
	* fix the set/retrieve functions, which use boolean values
	  -->> mostly done, still need to fix parseAttribute() calls	
	* DOM level 2
	* DOM stylesheets, changes need to trigger the appropriate changes
	  in the rendering tree

XML:
	* lots of stuff in the Impl classes
	* parsing
	* entities
	* style sheet processing instructions

misc:
	* mouse handling
	* selection --> mostly done, still a bit buggy

JScript:
	* return value for events/ event propagation

Java:
	* support for the object element
	    --> mostly done
	* Java <--> HTMLWidget communication
	* turn kjava into a kpart

Attributes:
	* check fro unimplemented attributes

Memory usage:
	* use bitfields for lots of things (especially in the
	  DOM/CSS/rendering stuff)
	* try to make better use of shared objects, especially in the
	  RenderStyle
	* check for leaks
	* there's a mem leak with the style objects of anonymous
	  boxes (and ListMarkers).

Other:
        * there's a bug on correctly retrieving <textarea> text.
          see test/forms.html and compare it with the way all other
          browsers handle that code
