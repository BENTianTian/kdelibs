Here's what's still missing (without order):

Paragraphs:
	* BiDi
	* clean up the calcParagraph code

Parser:
	* handle adding of elements better

StyleSheets:
	* provide a cache for sheets
	* make them really CSS2 compliant

DOM:
	* lots of functions in the Impl classes

misc:
	* mouse handling
	  --> partly done (clicking works), selection/DND still missing
	* selection
	* make all destructors in the DOM virtual 

Frames:
	* frameset should be a QSplitter

JScript:
	* completely

Java:
	* completely

Attributes:
	* some attributes (%coreattrs, %events, and a few others)
	should be implemented in HTML(Inline/Block)Element and not in
	the classes themselves.
	  --> partly done

Rendering:
	* rendering is quite slow at the moment, because of missing 
	  checks on the bounding rectangle --> mostly done...
	* remove the currentStyle from the elements

Memory usage:
       * high at the moment. IMO the biggest reason is the immense
         usage by the style sheet objects
	 Still thinking about a better solution. Perhaps one
	 stylesheet object would do, and the element get their
	 information from there (something like document->styleSheet()->XXX()).
