Here's what's still missing (roughly in order of importance):

* Add a select(...) function to HTMLTextSlave so that "select all"
  works.

* check the remaining ascii() calls

* move the attribute parsing into the objects

* simplify the KHTMLWidget/KHTMLView api, perhaps add a widget, which
  is almost a browser (move some stuff from konqueror here...)

* use KURL instead of QString url everywhere for URL's. This
  would avoid quite some QString<-->KURL conversions
  WABA: But for the time being, a QString is much cheaper to
        store than a KURL, especially since we use HTMLStrings
        for this. The only extra time spend is in the KURL.url()
        call which isn't too much of an overhead. Most of the
        time we don't convert a QString to a KURL a second time,
        because most URLs on a page aren't used.
        (You usually only click on one link/URL)

* many functions using QString now could be changed to use references,
  to avoid copying of the string

* move the parsing of table tags into the main parser

* get rid of the blockingTokens in the tokenizer

* incremental table layout

* make the object tree reflect the real document structure.
  Needed for dynamic html

* perhaps split up htmlobj.* into several files

* charset support (--> kcharsets)

* some html-4 elements are still not supported

* add (use) more attributes

* BiDi support

* jscript

* java
