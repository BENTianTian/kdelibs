Here's what's still missing (without order):

General:
	* move all internal classes into namespace khtml

Paragraphs:
	* BiDi
	* clean up the calcParagraph code

Parser:
	* handle adding of elements better

StyleSheets:
	* rewrite them. Some ideas:
	* make one StyleSheet class for every styleSheet downloaded.
	* add a cache for them and a default styleSheet
	* every element get's a pointer to a StyleSheetElement, providing
	  the element with the needed functions setPainter(), restorePainter(),
	  and probably some hints for layouting()
	* Style sheets shouldn't affect performance.
	* each StyleSheetElement should use as few memory as possible.
	  One could make a generic class for them, and derive a couple of
          specific styleSheetElements for specific tasks.

DOM:
	* lots of functions in the Impl classes
	* fix the set/retrieve functions, which use boolean values
	  -->> mostly done, still need to fix parseAttribute() calls	
	* introduce assignment operators HTMLBodyElement b = Node n;
	  these should just set impl to 0 if the assignment is impossible

misc:
	* mouse handling
	* selection

Frames:
	* mostly done. One should make the resizing of frames look as in
	  konqueror

JScript:
	* return value for events/ event propagation

Java:
	* support for the object element
	* Java <--> HTMLWidget communication

Attributes:
	* some attributes (%coreattrs, %events, and a few others)
	should be implemented in HTML(Inline/Block)Element and not in
	the classes themselves.
	  --> mostly done

Rendering:
	* remove the currentStyle from the elements
	  --> see thoughts about styleSheets

Memory usage:
       * high at the moment. IMO the biggest reason is the immense
         usage by the style sheet objects
	 See thoughts about style sheets above. After KRASH.
