Malicious Redirects

I advice the following:

* We should never allow a redirect from a HTTP to any other protocol, including 
  HTTPS. (OK. The current implementation does not allow redirects to other 
  protocols)

* We should provide a HTTP referer header iff the referer is on the same host
as the requested object. (We currently don't support referer headers)

* Either a) Don't allow POST or GET actions from javascript.
  or b) _Always_ ask the user for confirmation when javascript requests a 
        POST or GET action.
  Additional note: Simple requests for e.g. images are also GET actions, 
  disabling them would break a lot of javascript scripts.


SSL certificates

We never check SSL certificates. This makes https just as insecure as http.
