* does RenderObject really need attach()/detach()?
  IMO, we should leave it in the DOM part, since the RenderObjects
  will only get created when attached to a widget anyway.

Why should DOM objects have anything to do with widgets? Attach/detach 
is stricly rendering related, as far as I see. I'm not sure if it is
required in the base class, though.

Not really. All we have at the beginning is a DOM tree, which is created 
by the parser. Then we attach this tree to a widget, and it'll create the 
rendering tree. We will only have a rendering tree, if the DOM tree is 
attached to the widget. So the rendering tree won't need attach/detach,
because it'll only get created in case we have a widget. If we remove the 
DOM tree from the widget, the rendering tree should get deleted again.
I'd like to chache DOM trees later on, but caching rendering trees is not 
worth it IMO, because they use up to much space in memory. 

Anyway, the Rendering elements don't need to know more about the widget than 
it's size, which we can set on the root rendering object.

Lars, why have you prefixed all types with khtml:: ? That is not
required within the scope of the namespace.
</antti>

I did it, because the class was in namespace DOM at the beginning.
Then I realized, that it belongs to khtml, but didn't remove the prefixes.
Just lazyness ;-)
