This module contains the ECMAScript a.k.a. JavaScript language bindings for
the KHTML Part. A series of functions and properties will be added in
kjs_html_init() to the pre-existing set of the KJS library. The module will
be loaded into KHTML's address space on demand.

To test the non-HTML DOM functions you may compile a little interactive
interpreter called 'testecma' with 'make check' (see testecma.cpp for
further details).
