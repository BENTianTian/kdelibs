Has to be done
==============
- window.onload (code is there but doesn't work)
- frame handling (parent, top, frame[])
- return a window object in window.open()
- make window. prefix implicit for alert() etc. Adding Window as Global's
  prototype should be an elegant solution but failed at the first try
- preload pixmap if src property of an Image type is set
- optional error message output

Could be done
=============
- should we support Microsoft's document.all property ? It's not part of the
  DOM and use should be discouraged. We'd need HTMLDocument::all() for that.
- make navigator.userAgent configurable for those sites that test for Netscape
  or Explorer explicitly
