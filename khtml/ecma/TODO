Has to be done
==============
- frame[] correct search and sorting order
- preload pixmap if src property of an Image type is set
- optional error message output
- set this.form in event handlers of form elements
- change KParts::WindowArgs && friends 
  that we can detect if a locationbar is on/or not

Could be done
=============
- Your wish here :)
