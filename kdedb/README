==============================

Author

Basic design and implementation from:

Structure
---------
KDB is divided in 5 pieces:

* lib/kdbcore: the base data access library
* lib/kdbui: the widgets and dialogs library
* plugins: low level DBMS access 
* kio_sql: an IOSlave that enables browsing of sql databases
* test: a small test program


Status
------
The library must be considered in early ALPHA stage of development. This means
that program developed with the current version of the libs may not even compile 
with the subsequent versions. Many features are missing, altought are in the 
documentation and an API is provided


Support
-------
Anyone that is willing to support the development of KDB with patches, plugins, 
bug reports and such is welcome. Please send all material to pradu@thekompany.com.
If you want cvs write access, please contact me at pradu@thekompany.com


License
-------
The libraries themselves have been covered 
by the GNU Library General Public License (LGPL).  The test program
is covered by the GNU General Public License (GPL).  All the
gory details for the LGPL reside in COPYING.LIB, and for the GPL reside in 
COPYING.

When in doubt, check the individual file, they should all have license
headings and other identifying marks.
