$Id$ <-- we NEED that

This is the PostgreSQL plugin.  I'm working on it now. I'm using pgsql
7.0.3 for now.  It's got some things implemented that the mySQL plugin
doesn't, and somethings aren't implemented that mySQL has.  This is mainly 
due to pgsql having a bunch of features that mySQL doesn't, but at the 
same time making some of the features like "ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN" 
infinately more difficult.  Yay that.
