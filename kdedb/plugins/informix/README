The setup the enviroment to be able to compile Informix you need to do 
the following:

1) In the tools directory there is a shell called esql_c++.sh. Read the 
   installation instructions for this shell at the top of it. You will
   need to install this to be able to compile esql modules under a C++
   compiler.
2) Make sure the following environment variables are set:
   INFORMIXDIR=informix_install_dir
   INFORMIXSERVER=name_of_server
   ESQLC_VERSION=esqlc_version - obtained by running esql -v
   ESQLC_CPLUSPLUS_EXTENSION=.cpp
   INFORMIXCPP=g++ - or whatever C++ compiler you are using
3) Make sure that $INFORMIXDIR/bin is in your PATH, $INFORMIXDIR/lib and 
   $INFORMIXDIR/lib/esql are in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH or in ld.conf.
   You may also need $INFORMIXDIR/incl in the CPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR

Currently this directory doesn't configure "out of the box" so to speak.
I don't know enough about autoconf etc yet to get this to work properly.
So, after running configure copy Makefile.am.bak to Makefile.am and 
configure.in.in.bak to configure.in.in and then run make. It will stop with 
an error after creating Makefile.in. Copy Makefile.in.bak to Makefile.in and
it should all compile fine.
