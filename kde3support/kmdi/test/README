This example shows the use of K3Mdi.
Either you inherit your views from K3MdiChildView or you wrap your common widgets by K3MdiChildViews.
Your main widget must inherit from K3MdiMainFrm.



Call
  qmake kFourChildren -o Makefile
  make
to build the example app.
Likely you must set the environment variable KDEDIR (to e.g. /opt/kde3).
