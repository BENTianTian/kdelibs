This directory contains the src subdirectory of the Nana
distribution. No scripts are installed from here. 
The goal is to make sure we are able to use Nana statements in KDE
sources, no matter if the whole library is installed on the system. 
For information on how to use Nana, see the Nana documentation (HTML,
dvi or Postscript) at
http://www.cs.ntu.edu.au/homepages/pjm/nana-home/index.html
On any problems caused by the interaction of Nana with KDE code,
contact me (Mirko Sucker) using the email address mirko@kde.org.
