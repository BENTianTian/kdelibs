<h1>Latency & CPU usage</h1>
<p>
<h2>What is latency</h2>
<p>
Suppose you have an application "mousepling" that should to do pling if
you click on a button. The latency is the time between your finger clicks
the mouse button and you hearing the pling.
<p>
The latency in this setup composes itself out of certain latencies, that
have different causes.
<p>
<h2>Simple applications</h2>
<p>
<ol>
<li>the time until the kernel has notified the X11 server that a mouse
    button was pressed
<li>the time until the X11 server has notified your application that a
    mouse button was pressed
<li>the time until the mousepling application has decided that this button
    is worth playing a pling
<li>the time it takes the mousepling application to tell the soundserver
    that it should play a pling
<li>the time it takes for the pling (which the soundserver starts mixing
    to the other output at once) to go through the buffered data, until
	it really reaches the position where the soundcard plays
<li>the time it takes the pling sound from the speakers to reach your ear
</ol>
<p>
<h4>1.-3. "External" latencies</h4>
<p>
The points 1-3 are interesting, but beyond the scope of this document.
Nevertheless be aware that they exist, so that even if you have optimized
everything else to really low values, you may not necessarily get exactly
the result you calculated.
<p>
<h4>4. Time to tell the server to play something</h4>
<p>
Telling the server to play something involves usually one single MCOP call.
There are benchmarks which confirm that on the same host with unix domain
sockets, telling the server to play something can be done about 9000 times
in one second with the current implementation.
<p>
I expect that most of this is kernel overhead. Mostly switching from one
application to another. Of course this value changes with the exact type
of the parameters. If you transfer a whole image with one call, it will
be slower than if you transfer only one long value. For the returncode
the same is true. However for ordinary strings (such as the filename of
the wav file to play) this shouldn't be a problem.
<p>
That means, we can approximate this time with 1/9000 sec, that is below
<b>0.15 ms</b>. We'll see that this is not relevant.
<p>
<h4>5. Time between the server starts playing and the soundcard gets something</h4>
<p>
The server needs to do buffering, so that when other applications are
running, such as your X11 server or "mousepling" application no dropouts
are heard.
<p>
The way this is done under linux is that there are a number fragments of
a size. The server will refill fragments, and the soundcard will play
fragments.
<p>
So suppose there are three fragments. The server refills the first, the
soundcard starts playing it. The server refills the second. The server
refills the third. The server is done, other applications can do something
now.
<p>
As the soundcard has played the first fragment, it starts playing the second
and the server starts refilling the first. And so on.
<p>
The maximum latency you get with all that is (number of fragments)*(size of
each fragment)/(samplingrate * (size of each sample)).
<p>
Suppose we assume 44kHz stereo, and 7 fragments a 1024 bytes (the current
aRts defaults), we get <b>40 ms</b>.
<p>
These values can be tuned according to your needs. However, the CPU usage
increases with smaller latencies, as the sound server needs to refill the
buffers more often, and in smaller parts. It is also mostly impossible to
reach better values without giving the soundserver realtime priority, as
otherwise you'll often get drop-outs.
<p>
However, it is realistic to do something like 3 fragments with 256 bytes
each, which would make this value <b>4.4 ms</b>.
<p>
With 4.4ms delay the idle CPU usage of aRts would be about 7.5%. With 40ms
delay, it would be about 3% (of a PII-350, and this value may depend on
your soundcard, kernel version and others).
<p>
<h4>6. The time it takes the pling sound from the speakers to your ear</h4>
<p>
Suppose your distance from the speakers is 2 meters. Sound travels at a
speed of 330 meters per second. So we can approximate this time with
<b>6 ms</b>.
<p>
<h2>Streaming applications</h2>
<p>
Streaming applications are applications that produce their sound themselves.
Assume a game, which outputs a constant stream of samples, and should now
be adapted to replay things via aRts. To have an example: when I press a
key, the figure which I am playing jumps, and a boing sound is played.
<p>
First of all, you need to know how aRts does streaming. Its very similar
to the I/O with the soundcard. The game sends some packets with samples
to the sound server. Lets say three packets. As soon as the sound server
is done with the first packet, it sends a confirmation back to the game
that this packet is done.
<p>
The game creates another packet of sound and sends it to the server.
Meanwhile the server starts consuming the second sound packet, and so on.
<p>
The latency here looks similar like in the simple case.
<p>
<ol>
<li>the time until the kernel has notified the X11 server that a key
    was pressed
<li>the time until the X11 server has notified the game that a key was pressed
<li>the time until the game has decided that this key is worth playing a boing
<li>the time until the packet of sound in which the game has started putting
    the boing sound is reaching the sound server
<li>the time it takes for the boing (which the soundserver starts mixing
    to the other output at once) to go through the buffered data, until
	it really reaches the position where the soundcard plays
<li>the time it takes the boing sound from the speakers to reach your ear
</ol>
<h4>1.-3. "External" latencies</h4>
<p>
As above - beyond the scope of this document
<p>
<h4>4. Streaming latency</h4>
<p>
Obviously, the streaming latency depends on the time it takes all packets
that are used for streaming to be played once. So it is

(number of packets)*(size of each packet)/(samplingrate * (size of each sample))

<p>
As you see that is the same formula as applies for the fragments. However for
games, it makes no sense to do such small delays as above.
<p>
I'd say a realistic configuration for games would be 2048 bytes per packet,
use 3 packets. The resulting latency would be <b>35ms</b>.
<p>
This is based on the following: assume that the game renders 25 frames per
second (for the display). It is probably safe to assume that you won't notice
a difference of sound output of one frame. Thus 1/25 second delay for
streaming is acceptable, which in turn means 40ms would be okay.
<p>
Most people will also not run their games with realtime priority, and the
danger of drop-outs in the sound is not to be neglected. Streaming with 3
packets a 256 bytes is possible (I tried that) - but causes a lot of cpu
usage for streaming.
<p>
<h4>5.-6. Server side latencies</h4>
<p>
You can calculate these exactly as above.
<p>
<h2>Some CPU usage considerations</h2>
<p>
There are a lot of factors which influence cpu usage in a complex scenario,
with some streaming applications and some others, some plugins on the server
etc. To name a few:
<p>
<ol>
<li>raw CPU usage by the calculations necessary
<li>aRts internal scheduling overhead - how aRts decides when which module
    should calculate what
<li>integer &lt;-&gt; float conversion overhead
<li>MCOP protocol overhead
<li>kernel: process/context switching
<li>kernel: communication overhead
</ol>
<p>
<h4>1. raw CPU usage for calculations</h4>
<p>
If you play two streams, simultaneuosly you need to do additions. If you
apply a filter, some calculations are involved. To have a simplified example,
adding two streams involves maybe four CPU cycles per addition, on a 350Mhz
processor, this is 44100*2*4/350000000 = <b>0.1% CPU usage</b>.
<p>
<h4>2. aRts internal scheduling</h4>
<p>
aRts needs to decide which plugin when calculates what. This takes time.
Take a profiler if you are interested in that. Generally what can be said
is: the less realtime you do (i.e. the larger blocks can be calculated
at a time) the less scheduling overhead you have. Above calculating blocks
of 128 samples at a time (thus using fragment sizes of 512 bytes) the
scheduling overhead is probably not worth thinking about it.
<p>
<h4>3. integer &lt;-&gt; float conversion overhead</h4>
<p>
aRts uses floats internally as data format. These are easy to handle and
on recent processors not slower than integer operations. However, if there
are clients which play data which is not float (like a game that should do
its sound output via aRts), it needs to be converted.
<p>
The same applies if you want to replay the sounds on your soundcard. The
soundcard wants integers, so you need to convert.
<p>
TODO: if anybody has numbers how much conversion usually takes, insert here.
<p>
<h4>4. MCOP protocol overhead</h4>
<p>
MCOP does, as a rule of thumb, 9000 invocations per second. Much of this
is not MCOPs fault, but relates to the two kernel causes named below.
However, this gives a base to do calculations what the cost of streaming
is.
<p>
Each data packet transferred through streaming can be considered one
MCOP invocation. Of course large packets are slower than 9000 packets/s,
but its about the idea.
<p>
Suppose you use packet sizes of 1024 bytes. Thus, to transfer a stream
with 44kHz stereo, you need to transfer 44100*4/1024 = 172 packets per
second. Suppose you could with 100% cpu usage transfer 9000 packets, then
you get (172*100)/9000 = <b>2% CPU usage</b> due to streaming with 1024 byte
packets.
<p>
That are approximations. However, they show, that you would be much
better off (if you can afford it for the latency), to use for instance
packets of 4096 bytes. We can make a compact formula here, by calculating
the packet size which causes 100% cpu usage as 44100*4/9000 = 19.6 samples,
and thus getting the quick formula:
<p>
streaming cpu usage in percent = 1960/(your packet size)
<p>
which gives us <b>0.5% CPU usage</b> when streaming with 4096 byte packets.
<p>
<h4>5. kernel: process/context switching</h4>
<p>
(This is part of the MCOP protocol overhead).
<p>
Switching between two processes takes time. There is new memory mapping,
the caches are invalid, whatever else (if there is a kernel expert reading
this - let me know what exactly are the causes).
<p>
This means: it takes time. I am not sure how many context switches linux
can do per second, but that number isn't infinite. Thus, of the MCOP protocol
overhead I suppose quite a bit is due to context switching. In the beginning
of MCOP, I did tests to use the same communication inside one process, and
it was much faster (four times as fast or so).
<p>
<p>
<h4>6. kernel: communication overhead</h4>
<p>
(This is part of the MCOP protocol overhead).
<p>
Transferring data between processes is currently done via sockets. This is
convenient, as the usual select() methods can be used to determine when
a message has arrived. It can also be combined with other I/O sources as
audio I/O, X11 server or whatever else easily.
<p>
However, those read and write calls cost certainly processor cycles. For
small invocations (such as transferring one midi event) this is probably
not so bad, for large invocations (such as transferring one video frame
with several megabytes) this is clearly a problem.
<p>
Adding the usage of shared memory to MCOP where appropriate is probably the
best solution. However it should be done transparent to the application
programmer.
<p>
Take a profiler or do other tests to find out how much exactly current audio
streaming is impacted by the not using sharedmem. However, its not bad, as
audio streaming (replaying mp3) can be done with 6% total CPU usage for
artsd and artscat (and 5% for the mp3 decoder). However, this includes all
things from the necessary calculations up do the socket overhead, thus I'd
say in this setup you could perhaps save 1% by using sharedmem.
<p>
<h2>Some hard numbers</h2>
<p>
These are done with the current development snapshot. I also wanted to try
out the real hard cases, so this is not what everyday applications should
use.
<p>
I wrote an application called streamsound which sends streaming data to aRts.
Here it is running with realtime priority (without problems), and one small
serverside (volume-scaling and clipping) plugin:
<pre>
 4974 stefan    20   0  2360 2360  1784 S       0 17.7  1.8   0:21 artsd
 5016 stefan    20   0  2208 2208  1684 S       0  7.2  1.7   0:02 streamsound
 5002 stefan    20   0  2208 2208  1684 S       0  6.8  1.7   0:07 streamsound
 4997 stefan    20   0  2208 2208  1684 S       0  6.6  1.7   0:07 streamsound
</pre> 
<p>
Each of them is streaming with 3 fragments a 1024 bytes (18 ms). There are
three such clients running simultaneously. I know that that does look a bit
too much, but as I said: take a profiler and find out what costs time, and
if you like, improve it.
<p>
However, I don't think using streaming like that is realistic or makes sense.
<p>
To take it even more to the extreme, I tried what would be the lowest latency
possible. Result:
<p>
You can do streaming without interruptions with one client application,
if you take 2 fragments of 128 bytes between aRts and the soundcard, and
between the client application and aRts. This means that you have a total
maximum latency of 128*4/44100*4 = 3 ms, where 1.5 ms is generated due
to soundcard I/O and 1.5 ms is generated through communication with aRts.
<p>
Both applications need to run realtimed.
<p>
But: this costs an enormous amount of CPU. This example cost you about 45%
of my P-II/350. I also starts to click if you start top, move windows on
your X11 display or do disk I/O. All these are kernel issues. The problem
is that scheduling two or more applications with realtime priority cost
you an enormous amount of effort, too, even more if the communicate, notify
eachother etc.                                                                  
<p>
Finally, a more real life example. This is aRts with artsd and one artscat
(one streaming client) running 16 fragments a 4096 bytes:
<pre> 
 5548 stefan    12   0  2364 2364  1752 R       0  4.9  1.8   0:03 artsd
 5554 stefan     3   0   752  752   572 R       0  0.7  0.5   0:00 top
 5550 stefan     2   0  2280 2280  1696 S       0  0.5  1.7   0:00 artscat
