aRts-0.5.3:
- performance improvement for aRts midi instruments (bus code rewritten)
- structures designed by artsbuilder can be used modules in structures again
  (and elsewhere), via generic Arts::Loader's

aRts-0.5.2:
- threading support (libmcop-mt)
- glib-2.0 mainloop integration (libgmcop)
- KArtsWidget makes it easy to use Arts::Widget implementations in conjunction
  with qt widgets (i.e. no extra window), this also removes the annoying extra
  window in artscontrol
- generic gui factory used by noatun and artscontrol to create effect guis

This file starts in the middle of nowhere, because it hasn't always been

error in a comment probably doesn't count, doing one of the TODO items
most certainly does).
