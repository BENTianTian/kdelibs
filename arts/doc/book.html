<h1>How to get the multimedia chapter in the KDE2.0 Book</h1>
<p>
There is a KDE2.0 Development book which is freely available (under OpenContent
license) includes a good introduction about how to develop with aRts.
It doesn't cover all aspects, but should give a good overview.
<p>
It's Chapter 14. You can get it as PDF <a href="http://webs1152.im1.net/kde20devel/Files/PDF/chapter14.pdf">here</a>, and find the whole book online, and
the included example source code <a href="http://www.andamooka.org/kde20devel/">
here</a>.
