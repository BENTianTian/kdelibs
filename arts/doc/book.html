<h1>How to get the multimedia chapter in the KDE2.0 Book</h1>
<p>
There is a KDE2.0 Development book which is freely available (under OpenContent
license) includes a good introduction about how to develop with aRts.
It doesn't cover all aspects, but should give a good overview.
<p>
It's Chapter 14. You will find the book online at <a href="http://www.andamooka.org/kde20devel/">http://www.andamooka.org/kde20devel</a>. If you want to go directly to the download of the chapter and/or sourcecode in various formats, you might want to look <a href="http://www.andamooka.org/kde20devel/Files">here</a>.
