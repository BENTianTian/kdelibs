A note about the licensing:

aRts currently is GPL, and so are the things I've written for mcop right
now. However, if there are parts in mcop/aRts that will have some library
like character (like libmcop), I'll change the license to LGPL later.

It's just that I currently can't yet see what parts should have which
license. (Most of aRts will be rearranged/touched due to moving from CORBA
to MCOP).

As there have been different opinions, whether or not linking GPLd programs
and Qt is legal, I also added an explicite notice which allows that,
additional to the GPL.

    Permission is also granted to link this program with the Qt
    library, treating Qt like a library that normally accompanies the
    operating system kernel, whether or not that is in fact the case.
