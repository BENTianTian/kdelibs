A note about the licensing:

All libraries that are in aRts are LGPL. 95% of all aRts code is in the
libraries, including the whole MCOP and ArtsFlow stuff. So you can use that
wherever you like. This also allows you writing plugins and not open up the
source, if you want that.

There are a few programs (such as artsd), these are GPLd. As there have been
different opinions, whether or not linking GPLd programs and Qt is legal, I
also added an explicite notice which allows that, additional to the GPL.

    Permission is also granted to link this program with the Qt
    library, treating Qt like a library that normally accompanies the
    operating system kernel, whether or not that is in fact the case.
