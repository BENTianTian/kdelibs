HOWTO Make KDED Modules
=======================

KDED Modules are very similar to modules for the control center. 
A KDED Module is loaded when a call is made to it.

Here are examples of KDED modules:
 kdelibs/kioslave/http/kcookiejar/kcookieserver.cpp  Cookie-handling module (including GUI)
 kdelibs/kio/misc/kwalletd/kwalletd.cpp              KWallet module, handles the wallet file
 kdelibs/kdeui/shortcuts/kdedglobalaccel.cpp         Global-shortcuts module, for desktop-wide key shortcuts like Alt+F2
 kdebase/apps/lib/konq/favicons/favicons.cpp         Favicons module, for downloading favicon.ico files when browsing
 kdebase/runtime/kpasswdserver/kpasswdserver.cpp     Password-caching module

A KDED module should install a .desktop file with
	ServicesTypes=KDEDModule

A KDED module will be loaded on KDE startup if it has a line
	X-KDE-Kded-autoload=true

Note that this flag doesn't cause the module to be loaded if the KDE desktop
is not running (i.e. when running a KDE application in another environment).

Normally KDED modules are loaded whenever they are accessed, so you don't
need autoloading enabled. On demand loading can be disabled by putting
the following line in the .desktop file:
	X-KDE-Kded-load-on-demand=false

Further it should contain:
	X-KDE-Library=foo

Which means that kded_foo.so is the name of the library that contains
the module. Note that the name of the library always starts with kded_.

The .desktop file should be installed to ${SERVICES_INSTALL_DIR}/kded
