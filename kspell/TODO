from Wolfram Diestel:

- add more charsets - need support from users of this charsets
- rewrite the all the stuff to make it more asynchronous:
   o one process should send data
   o one process should read data
  synchronisation is done only by counting empty output lines from ispell


old todo from David Sweet
-------------------------

properly handle capitalization on "Replace All" (in parseOneResponse())

ensure that KSpell is reusable with the same replace/ignore lists
 for multiple spellchecks in a single editing session

allow saving of ignore/replace lists for multiple spellchecks of a
  given document across multiple sessions

add a "move()" function to move the dialog box (calling app should use this
	in response to a mispelled() signal to move the d.b.  out of the way
	of the misspelled word)
 This is done, but it doesn't work on the first call -- any ideas?
