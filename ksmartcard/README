How it works:


kpcsc is the lowlevel interface to the library
kcardreader is the representation of a card reader

ksmartcard is the high level interface for apps and kded to use smartcards

kardsvc is the kded module  -- apps should try to use this via dcop instead
                               of using ksmartcard directly

kcmkard - kcontrol module for configuring smartcard preferences.



CAVEATS:
  Don't delete kpcsc before you're done with all the KCardReaders.  I'll try
  to make this hard to do later.
