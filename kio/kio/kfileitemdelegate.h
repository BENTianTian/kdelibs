/**
 * KFileItemDelegate is intended to be used to provide a KDE file system
 * view, when using one of the standard item views in Qt with KDirModel.
 *
 * While primarily intended to be used with KDirModel, it uses
 * Qt::DecorationRole and Qt::DisplayRole for the icons and text labels,
 * just like QItemDelegate, and can thus be used with any standard model.
 *
 * To use KFileItemDelegate, instantiate an object from the delegate,
 * and call setItemDelegate() in one of the standard item views in Qt:
 *
 * @code
 * QListView *listview = new QListView(this);
 * KFileItemDelegate *delegate = new KFileItemDelegate(this);
 * listview->setItemDelegate(delegate);
 * @endcode
