Bugs:
=====

- addGroup does add the group, but the added items cannot be used. When
  a file is read again, the items are there, but not before.

- addItem does succeed even if the item is already there (is this ok?), but
  setValue afterwards fails in this case (which definitely is wrong)

- remvoveItem doesn't work (at least not with variable items)

- after a removeGroup, kfilemetainfo claims to get keys of an invalid
  metainfo object in the non-group-aware kfilemetainfo::preferredKeys()

- trying to add a key to a not-yet added group results in a crash
  QGDict::hashKeyString: Invalid null key


API enhancements:
=================

make the plugin work easier:
- bool added(KFileMetaInfoItem) and
- bool added(KFileMetaInfoGroup)
- bool removed(KFileMetaInfoItem) and
- bool removed(KFileMetaInfoGroup)

so the plugin can easily find out if an item/group was added/removed by the
user in writeInfo. Alternatively, KFMI could have added(KfileMetaInfoGroup)
and the group have added(KFileMetaInfoItem) and so on.

- removeGroup doesn't have a return value to check for success.
