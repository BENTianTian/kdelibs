Bugs:
=====

- addItem does succeed even if the item is already there (is this ok?)

- remvoveItem doesn't work (at least not with variable items)

- after a removeGroup, kfilemetainfo claims to get keys of an invalid
  metainfo object in the non-group-aware kfilemetainfo::preferredKeys()

Fixed:
======

- addGroup does add the group, but the added items cannot be used. When
  a file is read again, the items are there, but not before.

- trying to add a key to a not-yet added group results in a crash
  QGDict::hashKeyString: Invalid null key


API enhancements:
=================

- remove all the added/removed stuff. It doesn't seem to be neccessary any more

- removeGroup doesn't have a return value to check for success.
- remove() also not. Maybe it should be removedItem() in a group, and not
  remove() in the item itself
