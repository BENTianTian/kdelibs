libkio has two major functionalities : network-transparent I/O operations and 
system configuration cache (KSycoca).

KSycoca
=======

KMimeType :
  KDE-1.x users/developers know what mimetypes are.

KService :
  To a mimetype are bound one or more applications, now called services.
  Services can be applications, but also libraries, dynamically opened.

KServiceType :
  A service type allows the same mechanism to be extended to components.
  For instance : the question "what are the koffice plugins" is solved by
  a service type called KOfficePlugin, and by every plugin providing
  a .desktop file stating that it is a service that implements the servicetype
  KOfficePlugin.

To use those three classes, have a look at their static methods first.

KServiceTypeProfile :
  Stores the user's preferences for services bound to mimetypes/servicetypes.

KTrader :
  Use it to query for which services implement a given mimetype/servicetype.
  Has its own language, in order to allow complex queries.
