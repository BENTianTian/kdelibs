KDE Custom Widgets for Qt Designer 2
====================================


Summary:
========

This directory contains KDE custom widgets for designer 2 which comes with
Qt 3. Just make sure your plugin path in qtconfig includes
$KDEDIR/lib/kde3/plugins . With the KDE build system nothing special 
(i.e. editing the plugin path) is needed, as uic will automatically be
called with -L <path to the kdewidgets plugin> .

This plugin uses the QWidget plugin API of Qt >= 3.0
Don't expect it to work with any other versions of Qt.


Known Bugs:
===========

Designer crashes when using widgets that use the kapp pointer.

HOWTO Add Widgets:
==================
Just add new widgets to kde.widgets like this:
[ClassName]
IncludeFile=myheader.h
IconSet=mycoolwidget.png
ToolTip=My Cool Widget
WhatsThis=Long description of my cool widget
ConstructorArgs=(parent, name, otherNeccessaryArg)
IsContainer=true
Group=MyWidgetCollection

Everything but [ClassName] is optional.
IncludeFile defaults to classname.h (all lowercase)
IconSet defaults to classname.png (all lowercase)
ToolTip defaults to ClassName
WhatsThis defaults to ClassName
ConstructorArgs=(parent, name)
IsContainer defaults to false - note, any value except an empty one is
                                interpreted as true, even if the value
                                is "false" :) So, if the widget is not a
                                container, just omit this line.
Group defaults to "KDE"

If you somehow need extra includes in kdewidgets.cpp, add them to the
[Includes] section, additional code for the plugin constructor goes
to [Init], code for the destructor to [Destroy]

Have fun!
