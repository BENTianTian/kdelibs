KDE Custom Widgets for Qt Designer 2
====================================


Summary:
========

This directory contains KDE custom widgets for designer 2 which comes with Qt 3.
Just make sure your plugin path in qtconfig includes $KDEDIR/lib/kde3/plugins

This plugin uses the QWidget plugin API of Qt 3beta6. 
Don't expect it to work with any other versions of Qt.


Known Bugs:
===========

There are some problems left that cause designer to crash when creating certain widgets.


HOWTO Add Widgets:
==================
Just add new widgets to kde.widgets like this:
[ClassName]
IncludeFile=myheader.h
IconSet=mycoolwidget.png
ToolTip=My Cool Widget
WhatsThis=Long description of my cool widget
ConstructorArgs=(parent, name, otherNeccessaryArg)
IsContainer=true

Everything but [ClassName] is optional.
IncludeFile defaults to classname.h (all lowercase)
IconSet defaults to classname.png (all lowercase)
ToolTip defaults to ClassName
WhatsThis defaults to ClassName
ConstructorArgs=(parent, name)
IsContainer defaults to false - note, any value except an empty one is
                                interpreted as true, even if the value
                                is "false" :) So, if the widget is not a
                                container, just omit this line.

If you somehow need extra includes in kdewidgets.cpp, add them to the
[Includes] section, additional code for the plugin constructor goes
to [Init], code for the destructor to [Cleanup]

Have fun!
