Sockets:
========
- Write QSocksProxySocketImpl
- Adapt with a KDE class for KSocks
- Reimplement QSocketBase::setSocketDevice in QClientSocketBase and QServerSocket:
  -> must find out what the new socket's state is
- Clean up API
- Take tjansen's class for QNetworkInterface
- Write QMulticastSocket, QMulticastSocketImpl
- Write QSctpSocketImpl, QSctpStreamSocket, QSctpServerSocket

to be seen:
- Enhance QSocketImpl creation through requested capabilities
  (multicast, datagram, local-binding)

Resolver:
=========
- Test reverse resolution
- Add SRV-based resolution
  -> library that does low-level DNS (-lresolv), maybe in C
  -> the rest of the processing, sorting, etc. in C++
  to break dependency on -lresolv on the main library, maybe even allow
  for other DNS implementation
- Add PF_LLC to the resolving possibilities

General:
========
- Clean up documentation (go through Doxygen's errors)
