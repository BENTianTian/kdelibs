/**
 * @class QServerSocket qserversocket.h qserversocket.h
 * @brief A server socket for accepting connections.
 *
 * This class provides functionality for creating a socket to
 * listen for incoming connections and subsequently accept them.
 *
 * To use this class, you must first set the parameters for the listening
 * socket's address, then place it in listening mode.
 *
 * A typical example would look like:
 * \code
 *   QServerSocket *ss = new QServerSocket(service);
 *   QObject::connect(ss, SIGNAL(readyAccept()), this, SLOT(slotReadyAccept()))
 *   ss->listen();
 * \endcode
 *
 * In that case, this class will place the socket into listening mode on the
 * service pointed to by @p service and will emit the @ref readyAccept signal
 * when a connection is ready for accepting. The called slot is responsible for
 * calling @ref accept.
