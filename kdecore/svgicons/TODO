- Units.svg is wronk
- faster implementations of parseStyle, parseTransform, if needed
- smaller art_render_new areas, if needed
- make gradients work for boundingbox as well
- patterns
- handle <svg> nested inside <svg>

Things doubtful of supporting

- ICC color (possible, requires extra lib)
- text (possible, requires freetype)
- js (technically possible, but strongly related to user events)

Things that make no sense to support

- everything related to user input (mouse, keyboard events, linking)
