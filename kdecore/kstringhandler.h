/** General description of this class:
 *
 * This class is @bf not a substitute for the QString class. What
 * I tried to do with this class is provide an easy way to
 * cut/slice/splice words inside sentences in whatever order desired.
 * While the main focus of this class are words (ie characters
 * separated by spaces/tabs), the two core functions here (@ref split
 * and @ref join) will function given any char to use as a separator.
 * This will make it easy to redefine what a 'word' means in the
 * future if needed.
 *
 * I freely stole some of the function names from python. I also think
 * some of these were influenced by mIRC (yes, believe it if you will, I
 * used to write a LOT of scripts in mIRC).
 *
 * The ranges are a fairly powerful way of getting/stripping words from
 * a string. These ranges function, for the large part, as they would in
 * python. See the @ref word and @ref remword functions for more detail.
 *
 * This class contains no data members of it own. All strings are cut
 * on the fly and returned as new qstrings/qstringlists. 
 *
 * Quick example on how to use:
 *
 * <code>
 * KStringHandler kstr;
 * QString line = "This is a test of the strings";
 *
 * cout << "1> " << kstr.word( line , "4:" ) << "\n";
 * cout << "2> " << kstr.remrange( line , "2:5" ) << "\n";
 * cout << "2> " << kstr.reverse( line ) << "\n";
 * cout << "2> " << kstr.center( kstr.word( line , 4 ) , 15 ) << "\n";
 * </code>
 *
 * and so forth.
