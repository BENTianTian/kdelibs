/**
 * @version $Id$
 * @author David Sweet
 * @short A slightly simpler interface to KProcess
 *
 * KProcIO
 * By David Sweet (LGPL 1997)
 *
 * This class provides a slightly simpler interface to the communication
 *  functions provided by KProcess.  The simplifications are:
 *    1) The buffer for a write is copied to an internal KProcIO
 *        buffer and maintained/freed appropriately.  There is no need
 *        to be concerned with wroteStdin() signals _at_all_.
 *    2) readln() (or fgets()) reads a line of data and buffers any 
 *        leftovers.
 *
 * Added:
 *
 *    3) Conversion from/to unicode.
 *
 * Basically, KProcIO gives you buffered I/O similar to fgets()/fputs().
 *
 * Aside from these, and the fact that start() takes different
 *  parameters, use this class just like KProcess.
