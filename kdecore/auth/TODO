Todo list for libkauth:
- Add an option (either on build-time or at invocation time) to enable/disable the helper quit timeout.
  This is useful for debugging.
- Check with others on k-c-d if it's needed to add strings with error descriptions.

If the library gets included into kdelibs:
- Improve the example app, using KAuthorizedAction and KAuthorizedButton.
- Switch to kdelibs-specific things like kDebug(), kde4_add_executable(), etc...
- Rewrite the build files to fit into kdelibs and integrate FindKAuth.cmake into FindKDE4.
