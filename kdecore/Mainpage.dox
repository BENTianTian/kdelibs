/**
 * \mainpage The KDE Core Functionality Library
 *
 * All KDE programs use this library to provide basic functionality such
 * as the configuration system, IPC, internationalization and locale
 * support, site-independent access to the filesystem and a large number
 * of other (but no less important) things.
 *
 * All KDE applications should link to the kdecore library. Also, using a
 * KApplication derived class instead of QApplication is almost
 * mandatory if you expect your application to behave nicely within the
 * KDE environment.
