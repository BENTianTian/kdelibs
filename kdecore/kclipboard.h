/**
 * This class is mostly of internal use. You probably don't need it :)
 *
 * It provides an automatic synchronization of the X11 Clipboard and Selection
 * buffers. It connects to the selectionChanged() and dataChanged() signals of 
 * QClipboard and copies the buffer's contents to the other buffer, if configured.
 * 
 * Additionally to keeping them in sync, there is the option to automatically copy
 * the clipboard buffer to the selection buffer, when your application sets the
 * clipboard buffer. That is the default behavior in KDE.
 *
 * If you don't want any synchronizing or implicit copying, you can disable this
 * with the methods below.
 *
 * @short Allowing to automatically synchronize the X11 Clipboard and Selection buffers.
